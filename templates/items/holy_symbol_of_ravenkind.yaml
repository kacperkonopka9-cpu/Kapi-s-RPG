  full: |
    The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is a platinum amulet depicting the sun, with a large
    crystal embedded in its center. This sacred relic was created by the legendary cleric
    Tasha Petrovna, the Morninglord's champion, who used it in a great battle against
    Strahd shortly after his transformation. Though she was ultimately defeated, she
    wounded Strahd gravely with the symbol's holy light. The symbol has three powerful
    properties usable once per day each.
