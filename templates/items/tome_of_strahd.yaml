    The Tome of Strahd is a leather-bound book with thick parchment pages stained by
    age and blood. Written in Strahd's own elegant handwriting, it chronicles his life
    from military conquest of Barovia through his transformation into a vampire and
    centuries of isolation. The tome begins with accounts of his military campaigns,
    describes his growing jealousy of Sergei and love for Tatyana, details his pact
    with dark powers, and continues through 400 years of undeath. The most recent
    entries describe his encounters with Ireena and his hope that this time, Tatyana
    will be his. Reading the tome provides profound psychological insight into Strahd.
