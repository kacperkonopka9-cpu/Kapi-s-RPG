  notes: "Ismark is a tragic figure - earnest and good-hearted but burdened by guilt. He's nicknamed 'Ismark the Lesser' because villagers compare him unfavorably to his deceased father. Despite this, he's a capable fighter and utterly devoted to protecting Ireena. Key early-game ally and quest-giver."

  dmReminders:
    - "Ismark can join party to escort Ireena to Vallaki (DM's choice)"
    - "If Ireena dies, Ismark becomes suicidal with grief"
    - "Ismark doesn't know Ireena is Tatyana reincarnated - this is Strahd's secret"
    - "Nickname 'the Lesser' is unfair - Ismark is brave, just not legendary like his father"
