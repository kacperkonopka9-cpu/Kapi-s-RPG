# === NPC-SPECIFIC PERSONALITY ===
personality:
  traits:
    - "Obsessed with forced happiness as solution to Barovia's darkness"
    - "Tyrannical and controlling - demands absolute obedience"
    - "Paranoid about negativity, dissent, and Strahd's influence"
    - "Controlling father to Victor, neglectful husband to Lydia"

  ideals:
    - "Order - Strict control keeps chaos at bay (Lawful)"
    - "Optimism - Happiness, even forced, is better than despair (Neutral)"
    - "Authority - The Burgomaster's word is law (Lawful)"

  bonds:
    - "Vallaki - believes he's protecting town through strict control"
    - "Family legacy - maintaining Vallakovich authority over town"
    - "Izek Strazni - enforcer and adopted brother, absolute loyalty"

  flaws:
    - "Delusional about effectiveness of festivals against Strahd"
    - "Refuses to acknowledge son Victor's dangerous magic experiments"
    - "Blind to wife Lydia's unhappiness and alcoholism"
    - "Paranoid to point of arresting innocent citizens for 'malicious unhappiness'"

  mannerisms:
    - "Says 'All will be well!' constantly, especially when things are going poorly"
    - "Forced smile that doesn't reach his eyes"
    - "Points finger accusingly when questioning loyalty"
    - "Straightens posture and puffs chest when asserting authority"

  voiceDescription: "Booming and authoritative with forced cheerfulness. Every statement sounds like decree. 'All will be well!' is practically trademarked catchphrase."

  appearanceNotes: "Middle-aged man with graying hair, mustache, and cold blue eyes that contrast with forced smile. Wears fine noble clothes (velvet doublet, fur-trimmed cloak) and ceremonial scepter. Carries himself with exaggerated dignity. Expression cycles between forced cheerfulness and barely-concealed paranoia."

# === AI BEHAVIOR NOTES (for LLM DM) ===
aiBehavior:
  combatTactics: "Non-combatant. Immediately calls for guards and Izek if threatened. Hides behind guards while they fight. Uses Position of Authority to command reinforcements. Surrenders if guards defeated. No honor in combat - pure survival instinct."

  goals:
    - "Maintain absolute control over Vallaki"
    - "Execute perfect festivals to 'protect' town from Strahd"
    - "Crush dissent and enforce mandatory happiness"
    - "Preserve Vallakovich family authority"

  motivations:
    - "Genuine (if delusional) belief festivals protect town"
    - "Fear of Strahd's power - uses control as coping mechanism"
    - "Family pride and legacy as Burgomaster"
    - "Paranoia about chaos and unhappiness spreading"

  fears:
    - "Strahd attacking Vallaki directly"
    - "Losing control to Lady Wachter's revolution"
    - "Townspeople rebelling against his authority"
    - "Being proven wrong about festivals' protective power"

    - questId: "vallaki_revolution"
      role: "antagonist OR quest_giver"
      notes: "If party sides with Lady Wachter, Baron is antagonist to overthrow. If party sides with Baron, he tasks them with crushing revolution. Political branching quest."

  notes: "Baron Vargas Vallakovich is the tyrannical Burgomaster of Vallaki who believes forced happiness and weekly festivals will protect the town from Strahd. He arrests citizens for 'malicious unhappiness' and enforces mandatory participation in elaborate celebrations. His catchphrase 'All will be well!' masks deep paranoia and delusion. He can be antagonist (oppose his tyranny) or ally (support his authority) based on party choices. Non-combatant who relies on guards and enforcer Izek Strazni."

  dmReminders:
    - "Baron is DELUSIONAL but genuinely believes he's protecting Vallaki - not pure evil, just wrong"
    - "Political branching: party can side WITH Baron (stability/resources) OR against (revolution/freedom)"
    - "'All will be well!' should be used frequently - becomes darkly comedic as things get worse"
    - "Baron is non-combatant - runs or surrenders if guards defeated"
    - "Family dynamics reveal Baron's blind spots (Victor's magic, Lydia's alcoholism)"
    - "Festival of the Blazing Sun can succeed (Baron's favor) or fail catastrophically (revolution trigger)"
