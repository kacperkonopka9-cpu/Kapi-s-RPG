  initial: "We've taken shelter in an old townhouse on the outskirts of a foggy village. The place seems abandoned, but I can't shake the feeling that we're being watched. We should explore and see if we can find any clues about where we are."

      entry: "We've discovered the tragic fate of the Durst family. This house holds dark secrets - children's spirits, animated suits of armor, and evidence of terrible rituals. There's a secret door that leads to a dungeon beneath the house. We must investigate."

  completion: "We've escaped Death House alive, though barely. As we emerged into the fog, a letter from someone calling themselves 'Strahd von Zarovich' was waiting for us. He welcomes us to his land of Barovia and invites us to Castle Ravenloft. This is far from over."

dmGuidance:
  narrativeHooks:
    - "The children's ghosts (Rose and Thorn) can guide players through the house, building sympathy before revealing they're spirits"
    - "Describe the house as increasingly oppressive and dangerous as players descend"
    - "The nursery and library provide clues about the Durst family's tragic fate"
    - "The shambling mound is fed by the cult - describe bones and remains in the ritual chamber"
    - "After defeating the mound, the house itself becomes hostile - animated armor, grasping suits of clothes, collapsing stairs"

  roleplayTips:
    - "Rose and Thorn speak in childlike voices, asking for help finding their parents"
    - "The ghosts don't realize they're dead at first"
    - "Mrs. Durst's specter is malevolent - she blames outsiders for her family's fate"
    - "The house 'speaks' through creaking boards, slamming doors, and moving objects"

      monsters: []
      tactics: "After mound defeated: collapsing ceiling (DC 12 DEX), grasping rug (DC 10 STR), animated broom swarm (1d4 damage per turn)"

  commonPitfalls:
    - "Players may try to rest in the house - emphasize growing danger and hostility"
    - "Low-level parties can be overwhelmed by shambling mound - allow clever solutions (collapse ceiling, use oil and fire, kite it)"
    - "Players may get attached to Rose and Thorn - reveal they're ghosts gently, allow emotional goodbye"
    - "Some players avoid the basement entirely - Rose and Thorn can plead for parents' burial"

  alternatives:
    - "Players can negotiate with spirits - promise to bury the Durst family properly to calm the house"
    - "Clever players might set fire to the house instead of fighting the mound (risky but viable)"
    - "Players can escape through windows if they realize the house is a trap early"
    - "The letter from Strahd can be delivered by a raven instead of waiting at the exit"

lore:
  background: |
    Death House was once the home of Gustav and Elizabeth Durst, wealthy members of a dark cult that
    worshiped an entity they called the 'One who Sleeps in the Walls.' The Dursts performed human
    sacrifices in the basement, feeding victims to a shambling mound. When the cult was destroyed,
    the Dursts were killed by their own servants. Their children, Rose and Thorn, were locked in
    the attic and starved to death. The house itself is now a malevolent entity, luring travelers
    to their doom.

  connectionToMainStory: |
    Death House serves as the players' introduction to Barovia's gothic horror. It establishes that
    this is a land where innocents suffer, where families turn on each other, and where evil
    corrupts even the noblest intentions. The letter from Strahd at the end makes clear that the
    players are expected - they've been brought to Barovia for Strahd's amusement.

  historicalContext: |
    The Durst family was prominent in Barovia's history, owning a windmill (Old Bonegrinder) and
    extensive lands. Their fall from grace mirrors Barovia's own descent into darkness. The cult
    they served was likely connected to Strahd's own dark powers, though they didn't realize they
    worshiped a manifestation of Castle Ravenloft itself.
