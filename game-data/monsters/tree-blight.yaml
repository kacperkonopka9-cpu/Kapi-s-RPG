Slow (20 ft) but devastating when engaged. Use as immovable guardian or boss of blight encounters. Block chokepoints with huge size."

# === ECOLOGY & LORE ===
ecology:
  environment: "Wizard of Wines vineyard, Yester Hill (Gulthias Tree grove), corrupted forests"
  organization: "Solitary or grove (1 tree blight + 2-4 vine blights + 6-12 needle blights)"

lore:
  description: "Tree blights are the largest and most dangerous of the blight creatures, formed when entire trees are corrupted by the evil influence of Gulthias Trees. They stand 20-30 feet tall, appearing as massive dead trees with gnarled branches and roots. Tree blights serve as the shock troops and guardians of blight infestations, using their immense size and strength to crush enemies and destroy structures. When motionless, they are indistinguishable from dead trees, making them perfect ambush predators. In Barovia, tree blights guard the Gulthias Tree at Yester Hill and defend the corrupted areas of Wizard of Wines vineyard."
  weakness: "Vulnerable to fire (double damage), though high HP (149) requires multiple fire spells. Slow speed (20 ft). Low Intelligence. Huge size makes it easy target (hard to miss)."
  behavior: "Ambush with False Appearance (appear as dead tree). Multiattack branches (avg 36 damage/round). Use Siege Monster trait to destroy barricades and structures. Tank damage with high HP and resistances. Coordinate with smaller blights - tree blight frontline, vine blights grapple, needle blights ranged. Stand ground and fight to death (low Intelligence, no fear). Block passages with huge size."

# === ENCOUNTER DESIGN ===
encounterNotes:
  recommendedPartyLevel: 4
  encounterSize: "1 tree blight for medium, 1 tree blight + 2 vine blights + 6 needle blights for hard, 2 tree blights for deadly"
  terrain: "Wizard of Wines vineyard, Yester Hill Gulthias Tree grove, corrupted forest clearings"
  tactics: "WIZARD OF WINES DELIVERY QUEST: Tree blight boss of vineyard infestation. Huge size blocks chokepoints. Multiattack branches (avg 36 damage/round, reach 10 ft). False Appearance: Appears as dead tree until party approaches. Siege Monster: Double damage to winery doors/walls. HP 149 makes it soak tremendous damage. Fire vulnerability - Fireball (8d6 doubled = 16d6) is devastating but still requires multiple castings. Resistant to bludgeoning/piercing (martial characters less effective). Deploy with vine blights (grapple) and needle blights (ranged harassment)."
