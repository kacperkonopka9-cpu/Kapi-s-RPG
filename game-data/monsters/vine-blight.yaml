# === ECOLOGY & LORE ===
ecology:
  environment: "Wizard of Wines vineyard, Yester Hill, corrupted forests, vine-choked ruins"
  organization: "Solitary, pair, or tangle (3-6 vine blights + 6-12 needle blights)"

lore:
  description: "Vine blights are medium-strength blight creatures, more dangerous than needle blights due to their grappling and area control abilities. They appear as masses of thick, thorny vines twisted into a roughly humanoid shape. Vine blights excel at ambushes, using their False Appearance to blend in with normal vegetation until prey approaches. Once activated, they use Entangling Plants to create zones of difficult terrain filled with grasping roots, then constrict individual targets with their powerful vines. Like all blights, they are spawned by the corruption of Gulthias Trees and serve evil druids and dark forces."
  weakness: "Vulnerable to fire (double damage). Slow speed (10 ft). Low Dexterity (-1). Blindsight only 60 ft. Once grappling, can't constrict additional targets."
  behavior: "Ambush predators. Use False Appearance to blend with vines. Entangling Plants to control battlefield. Constrict to grapple and restrain high-priority targets (spellcasters). Restrained condition: Victim has disadvantage on attacks, attackers have advantage against victim. Hold grappled target until dead or help arrives. Flee from fire."

# === ENCOUNTER DESIGN ===
encounterNotes:
  recommendedPartyLevel: 2
  encounterSize: "1 vine blight for easy, 2-3 for medium, 4-6 for hard (with needle blights)"
