# === ECOLOGY & LORE ===
ecology:
  environment: "Abbey of St. Markovia, hidden communities in ruins"
  organization: "Solitary, pair, or community (10-30)"

lore:
  description: "Mongrelfolk are tragic humanoids afflicted with severe physical deformities - twisted limbs, misshapen heads, grotesque features. They are shunned by society and forced to hide in isolated places. In Barovia, a community of mongrelfolk dwells beneath the Abbey of St. Markovia under the protection of the Abbot. Despite their horrifying appearance, many mongrelfolk are kind-hearted and desperately seek acceptance. Each mongrelfolk has unique deformities but also one extraordinary feature (like darkvision, spider climbing, or amphibious breathing). They can mimic sounds and voices, sometimes using this to lure prey or call for help."
  weakness: "Low stats across the board. Slow speed (20 ft). Low Charisma (-2). Weak damage output."
  behavior: "Hide from outsiders. Use Mimicry to communicate or deceive. Extraordinary Features provide utility. Loyal to communities (Abbey mongrelfolk serve the Abbot). Some are good-aligned despite monstrous appearance. Avoid combat if possible."

# === ENCOUNTER DESIGN ===
encounterNotes:
  recommendedPartyLevel: 1
  encounterSize: "Non-combat roleplay encounter typically. If hostile: 2-4 mongrelfolk for easy, 6-10 for medium"
  terrain: "Abbey of St. Markovia, underground warrens, hidden communities"
  tactics: "ABBEY INVESTIGATION QUEST: Mongrelfolk are NOT enemies - they're victims seeking sanctuary. Roleplay > combat. Mimicry can confuse or frighten PCs. Extraordinary Features vary per individual (DM rolls d20). If attacked, flee to Abbot. Tragic figures deserving sympathy."
