lore:
  description: "Scarecrows are constructs animated by dark magic to serve as guardians. They stand motionless in fields, indistinguishable from ordinary scarecrows until prey approaches. When activated, they attack with frightening claws and a terrifying glare that can paralyze victims with fear. Scarecrows are bound to protect specific locations - fields, farms, or evil lairs. In Barovia, scarecrows guard Wizard of Wines vineyard and Old Bonegrinder windmill, animated by the druids and hags who control those locations."
  weakness: "Vulnerable to fire (double damage). Low damage output. No ranged attacks. Mindless (can be tricked with illusions)."
