# === AI BEHAVIOR ===
aiBehavior:
  combatTactics: "Low-level plant creature. Use Needles ranged attack (30/60 ft, 2d4+1) to harass from distance. Fall back to Claws if enemies close in (2d4+1 piercing). Vulnerable to fire - avoid fire spells and torches. Blindsight 60 ft allows fighting in darkness. Low HP (11) means fragile. Often deployed in groups to swarm enemies. No tactics or intelligence - just attack nearest threat."
  intelligence: "animal_intelligence"
  aggression: "high"
  groupTactics: "swarm"  # Deploy in groups

  preferredTargets:
    - "nearest threat"
    - "non-armored targets"

# === ECOLOGY & LORE ===
ecology:
  environment: "Wizard of Wines vineyard, Yester Hill, forests corrupted by Gulthias Tree"
  organization: "Patch (2-5), grove (6-12), or infestation (20+)"

lore:
  description: "Needle blights are the weakest and most common of the blight creatures spawned by the corrupting influence of Gulthias Trees. They appear as hunched, humanoid-shaped masses of thorny vines and dead wood, with needle-like spines covering their bodies. Needle blights can launch volleys of these needles at distant enemies. They are mindless servants of evil druids and dark forces, spreading blight and death wherever they go. In Barovia, needle blights infest the Wizard of Wines vineyard and Yester Hill, servants of the druids who worship Strahd."
  weakness: "Vulnerable to fire (double damage). Low HP (11). Low Intelligence (animal-level). Blindsight only 60 ft range."
  behavior: "Mindless plant creatures. Attack on sight. Use Needles ranged attack to harass. Claws in melee. Swarm tactics when in groups. Flee from fire. No self-preservation beyond fire avoidance. Serve evil druids and corrupting forces. Spread through forests like invasive species."

# === ENCOUNTER DESIGN ===
encounterNotes:
  recommendedPartyLevel: 1
  encounterSize: "2-3 needle blights for easy, 4-6 for medium, 8-12 for hard"
  terrain: "Wizard of Wines vineyard, Yester Hill, corrupted forests"
  tactics: "WIZARD OF WINES DELIVERY QUEST: Swarms of needle blights attack vineyard. Deploy in groups of 6-12. Needles ranged attack (30 ft) softens targets. Fire vulnerability means area fire spells (Burning Hands, Fireball later) devastate groups. Low HP (11) means they die quickly. Use terrain (vines, undergrowth) for cover. Pair with vine blights and tree blights for mixed encounters."
