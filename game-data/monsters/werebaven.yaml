# === AI BEHAVIOR ===
aiBehavior:
  combatTactics: "Use raven form for scouting and espionage. Transform to hybrid for combat (Regeneration active). Multiattack with shortsword + hand crossbow. Use Mimicry to distract or misdirect enemies. Aid party members - coordinate with PCs rather than fighting independently. Avoid killing when possible (neutral good alignment). Use flight to maintain range advantage."
  intelligence: "cunning"
  aggression: "low"  # Defensive, protective
  groupTactics: "coordinated"  # Work with PCs and Keepers

  preferredTargets:
    - "enemies threatening allies"
    - "Strahd's servants (vampires, werewolves)"
    - "major threats first"

# === ECOLOGY & LORE ===
ecology:
  environment: "Blue Water Inn (Vallaki), Wizard of Wines Winery, forests near settlements"
  organization: "Solitary, pair, or flock (3-8 with Keepers of the Feather)"

lore:
  description: "Wereravens are rare lycanthropes who retain their humanity and goodness despite the curse. In Barovia, wereravens form a secret society called the Keepers of the Feather, dedicated to opposing Strahd and protecting the innocent. They operate covertly, using raven form to spy on Strahd's forces and humanoid form to aid travelers discreetly. The Martikov family runs the Wizard of Wines winery and Blue Water Inn, serving as the Keepers' leadership. Unlike evil lycanthropes, wereravens willingly share their curse only with those who prove trustworthy and share their ideals. Those cursed with werebaven lycanthropy shift alignment to neutral good and often join the Keepers."
  weakness: "Silvered weapons bypass immunity and disable Regeneration. Lower combat power than werewolves (CR 2 vs CR 3). Pacifist tendencies limit aggression."
  behavior: "Wereravens prioritize information gathering and covert operations over direct combat. Use raven form for espionage - can infiltrate anywhere small bird can access. Mimicry allows social engineering and distraction. Hybrid form for combat when necessary (Regeneration makes them surprisingly durable). Coordinate with trusted allies, providing intelligence and support. Avoid unnecessary killing. Protect innocent civilians and oppose Strahd's forces subtly to avoid retaliation against their community."

If combat: Use flight and hand crossbow for hit-and-run. Hybrid Regeneration (10 HP/turn) makes them durable. Coordinate with PCs - heal, provide covering fire, distract enemies."
