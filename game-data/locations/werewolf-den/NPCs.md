# NPCs in Werewolf Den

## Kiril Stoyanovich

- **Type:** Human (Werewolf Alpha)
- **Age:** 38
- **Location:** Werewolf Den main cavern or leading hunts
- **Status:** Alive, brutal, corrupted by power
- **Relationship to Player:** Hostile
- **Quest Connection:** "Defeat Kiril," "Restore Emil," "Stop Werewolf Raids"

### Description

Kiril is a massive man even in human form, standing over six feet with bulging muscles and scars from countless fights. His eyes hold a feral gleam, and his teeth seem too sharp even before transformation. He wears minimal clothing—tattered pants and a vest made from human leather that disturbs all who see it. In hybrid form, he's a towering nightmare of fur, fangs, and claws.

Kiril represents the worst of werewolf nature—pure savagery with human cunning. He overthrew Emil's more balanced leadership through brutality, and under his rule the pack has become a threat to all settlements within raiding distance.

### Dialogue

- **When Found:** "Who... who are you? Have you come to finish me? Or... could it be... have you come to help?"
