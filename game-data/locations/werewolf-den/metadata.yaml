notes: "Werewolf Den is high-danger combat encounter with moral choice element. Primary threat: 8 CR 3 werewolves plus CR 5 alpha, all immune to non-silvered/non-magical weapons. Silvered weapon cache on-site provides solution. Multiple resolution paths: (1) Violent—kill entire pack, (2) Diplomatic—free Emil, support in leadership challenge vs. Kiril, reform pack, (3) Hybrid—kill Kiril, negotiate with survivors. Emil restoration is better outcome: ends raids on Krezk, frees children, creates neutral faction. Destroying pack also works but less elegant. Three kidnapped children must be rescued—time-sensitive moral imperative. Zuleika (Emil's wife) guards prison but conflicted—DC 16 Persuasion to stand aside. Letter in Kiril's chamber proves Strahd connection (raids are part of strategy to destabilize Krezk). Pack uses tactics: flanking, coordination, reinforcements from patrols. Best approach: silvered weapons essential, time assault for when hunting parties are out, free Emil first, support in challenge to Kiril, negotiate pack reform. If reformed, pack stops raids and becomes neutral—major win for Krezk. Children returned earn significant gratitude from Dmitri Krezkov. Total loot ~2745 gp but much should be returned to victims' families. Keepers of the Feather observe party's choices (violence vs. diplomacy). Connection to Krezk quest line: solving werewolf threat is prerequisite for village trust and Ireena sanctuary."
