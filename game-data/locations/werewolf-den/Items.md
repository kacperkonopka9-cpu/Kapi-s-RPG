## Loot Ethics and Practical Considerations

### Stolen Property
- Much of the wealth here was looted from victims
- Jewelry and personal items should ideally be returned to families
- Taking everything is theft from grieving families
- Returning items earns significant gratitude from Krezk

### Silvered Weapons
- Extremely valuable in Barovia (werewolves, vampires)
- Cache represents 325 gp worth of anti-lycanthrope weapons
- Essential for fighting werewolves without magic

### Pack Treasure
- If Emil restored to leadership, he allows party to take raided goods
- He insists children's belongings be returned to families
- If Kiril defeated, pack's treasure is legitimate loot

### Total Available Loot
- **Coinage:** ~940 gp total (if taking everything)
- **Weapons:** ~1075 gp (mostly silvered weapons)
- **Jewelry/Valuables:** ~530 gp
- **Potions:** 200 gp worth
- **Total:** ~2745 gp value, but much should be returned to victims' families

## Special Considerations

### Silvered Weapon Shortage
- Silvered weapons are rare in Barovia
- This cache represents significant combat advantage
- Essential for fighting Strahd's werewolf and vampire spawn allies

### Evidence Against Werewolves
- Human remains, children's items, stolen goods prove pack's crimes
- Can be used to justify actions to Krezk authorities
- Strahd's letter proves broader conspiracy

### If Pack Reformed Under Emil
- Emil allows party to keep weapons and raided treasure
- Insists on returning children and personal effects
- Offers pack's future cooperation and knowledge of mountain paths
- Pack will no longer raid settlements—major victory for Krezk

### If Pack Destroyed
- All loot available but ethically complicated
- Ravens (Keepers) observe party's choices
- Returning stolen items to families earns reputation
- Keeping everything earns wealth but damages standing
