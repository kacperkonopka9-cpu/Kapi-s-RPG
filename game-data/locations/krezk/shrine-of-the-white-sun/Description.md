# Shrine of the White Sun - Description

## Overview
Krezk's place of worship, a simple stone structure tended by Father Andrei. Villagers gather here twice daily for prayers to the Morninglord.

## Initial Description
Near the village center stands a modest stone shrine with a peaked roof and single wooden door. A carved sunburst symbol—the holy sign of the Morninglord—adorns the lintel. Through narrow windows, candlelight flickers. The bell in its small tower rings at dawn and dusk, calling the faithful to prayer.

Inside, wooden pews face a simple altar bearing another sunburst symbol. Candles burn perpetually. The air smells of incense and old stone. Despite its simplicity, the shrine radiates genuine faith—a fragile bastion of hope in this cursed land.

## Return Description
The shrine remains as before, doors open to any who seek solace. Father Andrei tends it faithfully, and villagers continue their prayers despite the darkness that surrounds them.
