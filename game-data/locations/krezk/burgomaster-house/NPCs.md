# Burgomaster's House - NPCs

## Primary NPCs

### Dmitri Krezkov
See parent location `krezk/NPCs.md` for full profile. In his house, Dmitri is a broken man sitting at his dying son's bedside, desperate for any hope of saving Ilya.

### Anna Krezkova
See parent location `krezk/NPCs.md` for full profile. At home, Anna alternates between praying at Ilya's bedside and weeping. Will beg party for help if they seem capable of healing.

### Ilya Krezkov
- **npcId**: `ilya_krezkov`
- **Status**: Dying (unconscious, bedridden)
- **Age**: 14 years old
- **Condition**: Wasting illness, no visible cause, fading life force
- **Days Remaining**: 3-7 days unless healed

**Appearance**: Pale, thin boy with dark hair. Once healthy and energetic, now skeletal. Breathing is shallow. Eyes occasionally flutter but don't open.

**Medical Assessment**: No disease, curse, or poison can be detected. Seems to be draining of life force itself. Requires Greater Restoration or stronger magic, blessed pool water, or Abbot's intervention.

**Emotional Weight**: Parents' entire world. His death would devastate them and destabilize Krezk's leadership.
