# Burgomaster's House - Description

## Overview

The Burgomaster's house is the largest residence in Krezk, a sturdy stone cottage with two floors and a thatched roof reinforced with slate. It sits near the village center, distinguished from surrounding homes by its size, quality construction, and the small garden (now neglected) that once surrounded it.

Currently, the house is a place of grief. Ilya Krezkov, the Burgomaster's fourteen-year-old son, lies dying in an upstairs bedroom. His parents, Dmitri and Anna, have barely left his side in weeks.

## Initial Description

You approach a well-built stone house larger than most in Krezk. Smoke rises from its chimney, and candlelight glows in upper windows even during the day. The front door is heavy oak, currently closed. A small wooden sign bears the Krezkov family crest—a mountain goat silhouetted against the sun.

As you near, you might hear weeping from within, or the low murmur of prayers. The atmosphere is heavy with sorrow.

## Return Description

The Burgomaster's house stands as before. If Ilya still lives, the same desperate vigil continues—candles in the windows, prayers murmured, parents taking turns at the bedside. If Ilya has died, the house is darker, shutters closed, mourning wreaths hung on the door.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Dawn light touches the house. If Ilya lives, Anna emerges briefly to draw water from the well, her face haggard. Dmitri may step outside for air, staring up at the Abbey with desperate hope or burning resentment.

### Night
Candlelight burns in the upstairs bedroom window all night. Shadows move behind the glass—parents at vigil. Occasionally, Anna's weeping can be heard, or Dmitri's voice raised in prayer to the Morninglord.

## Points of Interest

### Main Room
Ground floor living area with hearth (fire always burning), dining table, simple furniture. Food sits untouched—neighbors bring meals but the Krezkovs barely eat. Family portraits on walls, religious icons, mountain herbs hanging to dry.

### Ilya's Bedroom (Upstairs)
Small room dominated by the bed where Ilya lies. The boy is pale, thin, barely breathing. No wounds, no fever—just fading. Dmitri sits in chair by the bed, Anna kneels in prayer. Medicine bottles crowd the nightstand, all ineffective. Window looks out toward the Abbey.

### Parents' Bedroom
Adjacent to Ilya's room. Unused for weeks—both parents sleep (when they sleep) in chairs by their son's bed. Bed made but dusty. Family heirlooms in chest at foot of bed.

### Kitchen
Small cooking area, currently neglected. Dried herbs, preserved foods, basic supplies. Backdoor to small garden.

### Garden
Once well-tended, now overgrown. Medicinal herbs, vegetables, goats in small pen. Anna used to maintain this; now it's abandoned.
