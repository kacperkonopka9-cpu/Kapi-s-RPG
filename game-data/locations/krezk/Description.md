# Village of Krezk - Description

## Overview

The Village of Krezk perches on the western slope of Mount Baratok, a fortified settlement clinging to the mountainside high above the valley floor. Thick stone walls encircle the village, their weathered blocks mortared with determination against the darkness that plagues Barovia. Unlike the wood and thatch of other settlements, Krezk is built of mountain stone—gray, solid, enduring.

A single gatehouse guards the only entrance, manned day and night by suspicious guards who scrutinize every visitor. Within the walls, perhaps two hundred souls eke out an existence in small stone cottages clustered along steep cobbled paths. Above the village proper looms the Abbey of St. Markovia, once a bastion of healing, now fallen into sinister mystery.

## Initial Description

Your first glimpse of Krezk comes as you round a bend in the mountain road. The walled village rises from the mist like a fortress monastery, its stone ramparts following the natural contours of the mountainside. The gatehouse blocks the single entrance—a heavy structure with arrow slits and a fortified door that looks like it hasn't opened willingly in years.

As you approach, a guard's face appears at a murder hole above the gate. His voice is sharp, suspicious: "State your business! No one enters Krezk without the Burgomaster's approval!"

The air here is thin and cold, sharp with mountain wind that carries the scent of pine and stone. Mist often shrouds the lower slopes, while the peaks above remain clear but forbidding. Above and behind the village walls, the Abbey of St. Markovia crowns the hilltop, its bell tower stark against the gray sky. Even from here, there's something wrong about it—the windows are dark, the grounds overgrown, and an uneasy stillness hangs over the structure.

At the base of the walls, a natural pool of crystal-clear water glimmers—the blessed pool, holy spring and the only source of pure water in all Barovia, or so the villagers claim.

## Return Description

The gatehouse guards recognize you this time, though their suspicion hasn't entirely faded. The gate opens more readily now, but still with obvious reluctance. Inside, the village remains as cautiously quiet as before, windows shuttered, doors barred.

The villagers who do venture outside nod curtly as you pass, neither friendly nor hostile—simply wary. Some make the sign of the Morninglord as you approach, a protective gesture. The blessed pool at the village's base still glistens with crystal-clear water, its holy aura the only source of hope in this fearful place.

The Abbey looms above, ever-present, ever-watching. Its shadow falls across the village each evening, and with it comes an unspoken dread.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Dawn comes late to Krezk, blocked by the mountain peaks to the east. When sunlight finally spills across the stone walls, the village stirs reluctantly to life. Shutters crack open, villagers emerge to tend their goats or draw water from the blessed pool.

Smoke rises from a few chimneys as breakfast fires are lit. The guards at the gatehouse rotate shifts, their replacements looking as weary as those they relieve. Father Andrei rings the bell at the Shrine of the White Sun, calling the faithful to morning prayers. A few dozen villagers make their way there, heads down, voices hushed.

The Abbey bell tower catches the morning light, but no bells ring from its heights. The structure stands silent, watching.

### Night

After sunset, Krezk becomes a place of shadows and echoes. Torches flicker at the gatehouse, but beyond that, the village is dark save for the faint glow of candlelight through a few shuttered windows. The mountain wind carries strange sounds from the Abbey—sometimes screams, sometimes laughter, sometimes nothing at all, which is somehow worse.

The guards at the gate double their watch, speaking in hushed tones. No one enters or leaves after dark. The blessed pool glimmers faintly in the moonlight when the clouds part, its waters still and pure, untouched by the darkness that surrounds it.

The devout gather at the Shrine of the White Sun for evening prayers, their voices rising in hymns that sound more like pleas than praise. They know what prowls Barovia's night, and they pray the walls and their faith will keep it at bay.

## Points of Interest

### Village Gates
The only entrance to Krezk, a fortified gatehouse with thick wooden doors reinforced with iron bands. Guards stationed here day and night, captain is Boris the Gatekeeper. Entry requires Burgomaster's approval or compelling reason (wine delivery, urgent healing request, etc.).

### Blessed Pool
Natural spring at the base of the village walls. Crystal-clear water said to be blessed by the Morninglord or protected by Sergei's spirit. Father Andrei tends it weekly. Water heals minor ailments; legends suggest it can perform miracles like resurrection or curse-breaking. Village's most sacred site.

### Abbey of St. Markovia
Looms above the village on the mountainside. Once a monastery of healing, now home to the fallen deva known as the Abbot. Strange sounds emanate from it at night. The Abbot conducts grotesque "healing" experiments, creating mongrelfolk servants and building Vasilka, a flesh golem bride for Strahd.

### Shrine of the White Sun
Village place of worship, tended by Father Andrei. Villagers gather here twice daily for prayers. Simple stone structure with wooden pews, altar bearing sunburst symbol. Represents Krezk's deep faith and desperate hope.

### Burgomaster's House
Largest residence in the village, home to Dmitri Krezkov (Burgomaster), his wife Anna, and their dying son Ilya. Currently a house of grief as the parents watch their child waste away from mysterious illness.

### Village Square
Central cobbled area where paths converge. Usually empty save for guard patrols. In better times, market stalls would be here; now villagers avoid gathering in open spaces.

### Stone Walls
Thick fortifications encircling the entire village, built from mountain stone. Height of 15-20 feet with walkways for guards. Represent Krezk's isolation and defensive posture. Have never been breached in living memory.

### Mountain Paths
Steep cobbled lanes winding up the hillside, connecting the various parts of the village. Often slick with mist or ice. The path continuing upward from the village leads to the Abbey.

### Residential Quarter
Clustered stone cottages where the two hundred villagers live. Most are identical—single-story with slate roofs, small windows with heavy shutters, wooden doors that bar from inside. Built for survival, not comfort.

### Goat Pens
Simple enclosures where villagers keep their livestock. Goats provide milk, cheese, and meat. The animals are well-tended—they represent survival in this harsh place.
