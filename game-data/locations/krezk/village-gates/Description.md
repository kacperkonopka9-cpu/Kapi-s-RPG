# Village Gates - Description

## Overview
The only entrance to Krezk, a fortified gatehouse with heavy wooden doors reinforced with iron bands. Guards station here day and night under Boris the Gatekeeper's command.

## Initial Description
Krezk's single entrance is a formidable gatehouse built into the stone walls. The wooden doors—thick as a man's torso and banded with iron—stand closed. Murder holes pierce the stone above, and arrow slits line the walls. A small window with iron bars allows the guards to see who approaches without opening the gate.

As you near, a gruff voice calls down: "State your business! No one enters without the Burgomaster's approval!"

## Return Description
The gatehouse stands as before. If you've gained trust, the guards recognize you and the gates open more readily. If you're unwelcome, they bar your way with crossbows ready.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Guard shift changes at dawn. Fresh guards take position, yawning but vigilant. Gates may open briefly to let villagers tend outside fields.

### Night
Double watch after dark. Torches burn in sconces. No one enters or leaves. Guards are tense, knowing what prowls Barovia's nights.
