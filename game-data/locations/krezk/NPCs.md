# Village of Krezk - NPCs

## Major NPCs

### Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov
- **npcId**: `burgomaster_dmitri_krezkov`
- **Name**: Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov
- **Type**: Human (Noble)
- **Role**: Village Burgomaster, Community Leader
- **Age**: 55
- **Location**: Primarily at Burgomaster's House, occasionally at Village Gates or Shrine
- **Full Profile**: game-data/npcs/burgomaster_dmitri_krezkov.yaml

**Personality**: Stoic, deeply religious, protective of his people to the point of paranoia. Currently consumed by grief and desperation over his son Ilya's death. A good man pushed to the edge by helplessness and desperate hope that the Abbot can resurrect his son.

**Appearance**: Weathered man in mid-50s with gray beard and deep lines of grief on face. Simple but dignified clothing befitting village burgomaster. Somber expression, dark circles under eyes from sleepless nights. Carries himself with quiet dignity despite visible sorrow.

**Dialogue Snippets**:
- "Krezk has survived by staying small, staying quiet, staying closed. I will not risk my people for strangers."
- "The Abbot... he promises he can bring my boy back. What father wouldn't hope?"
- "If you seek entry to Krezk, bring wine from the Wizard of Wines. Prove your worth to this village."

**Quest Hooks**:
- Desperate to resurrect his dead son Ilya (body at Abbey with the Abbot)
- Will grant entry to Krezk if party delivers wine from Wizard of Wines
- Could be convinced to allow Ireena sanctuary at Abbey if trust is established

**AI Behavior Notes**: Dmitri is initially hostile to strangers but becomes an ally if the party demonstrates goodwill (wine delivery quest). His grief and desperate hope make him vulnerable to the Abbot's manipulation. He trusts Father Andrei and defers to religious guidance. Will break down emotionally when discussing Ilya.

### The Abbot
- **npcId**: `the_abbot`
- **Name**: The Abbot (true name unknown)
- **Type**: Celestial (Deva - fallen)
- **Role**: Master of the Abbey of St. Markovia, self-appointed healer
- **Age**: Ageless (appears middle-aged)
- **Location**: Abbey of St. Markovia (rarely leaves)

**Personality**: Insanely benevolent. Believes he is doing good while committing atrocities. Genuinely wants to "fix" Barovia but has become twisted by centuries of failure. Calm, serene, utterly convinced of his righteousness.

**Appearance**: Handsome humanoid features with an otherworldly quality—too perfect, too symmetrical. Golden eyes that glow faintly. Wears simple monk's robes that are always pristine despite the abbey's squalor. Radiates an aura of divine presence that feels wrong somehow.

**Dialogue Snippets**:
- "Welcome, travelers. All who suffer are welcome in my abbey. How may I ease your pain?"
- "Strahd is lonely, you see. If I can give him a companion—a bride worthy of his love—perhaps he will release his grip on this land."
- "The mongrelfolk? My children, my flock. I have given them purpose. Is that not mercy?"

**Quest Hooks**:
- Creating Vasilka, a flesh golem "bride" for Strahd
- Might heal Ilya or perform other miracles if party performs tasks for him
- Possesses dangerous knowledge about Barovia's curse

**AI Behavior Notes**: The Abbot is CR 15 and extremely dangerous if provoked. He does not see himself as evil—he genuinely believes his actions serve a greater good. He is patient, calculating, and has lived for centuries. Will not attack unless party threatens his work or destroys Vasilka. If combat begins, uses full deva abilities including flight, healing, and powerful radiant damage.

### Anna Krezkova
- **npcId**: `anna_krezkova`
- **Name**: Anna Krezkova
- **Type**: Human (Commoner)
- **Role**: Burgomaster's wife, Ilya's mother
- **Age**: Early 40s
- **Location**: Burgomaster's House (never leaves)

**Personality**: Broken by grief, desperate, willing to do anything to save her son. Gentle and kind by nature, now hollowed out by weeks of watching Ilya fade. Clings to any hope, no matter how slim.

**Appearance**: Thin and pale from lack of sleep and food. Long dark hair streaked with premature gray, worn loose and uncombed. Red-rimmed eyes from constant weeping. Wears a simple wool dress stained with tears and spilled broth from trying to feed Ilya.

**Dialogue Snippets**:
- "Please, if you have any skill with healing, any magic—help my boy. He's all I have."
- "The Abbot turned us away. Said Ilya's illness is 'beyond mortal concern.' What does that mean?"
- "I pray every hour, but the Morninglord doesn't answer. Why won't he answer?"

**Quest Hooks**:
- Will beg party to save Ilya if they seem capable
- Might offer family heirlooms as payment for healing
- Could provide information about the village if party helps

**AI Behavior Notes**: Anna is not a combatant. She is consumed by maternal grief and will react emotionally to any mention of hope or healing. Can provide tragic emotional weight to Ilya's questline.

### Father Andrei
- **npcId**: `father_andrei`
- **Name**: Father Andrei
- **Type**: Human (Acolyte)
- **Role**: Village priest, Shrine keeper
- **Age**: 60s
- **Location**: Shrine of the White Sun

**Personality**: Devout, humble, kind-hearted. The spiritual anchor of Krezk. Believes deeply in the Morninglord but privately doubts whether his prayers are heard in this cursed land. Tries to maintain hope for his flock despite his own crisis of faith.

**Appearance**: Elderly with wispy white hair and a gentle, weathered face. Wears simple priest's vestments—white robes with a sunburst symbol. Moves slowly, leaning on a walking stick. Kind eyes that have seen too much suffering.

**Dialogue Snippets**:
- "The Morninglord's light may seem distant here, but faith is the candle we carry through the darkness."
- "The blessed pool is a gift—perhaps the only true miracle remaining in Barovia. Treat it with reverence."
- "The Abbey was once our greatest hope. Now I fear what has become of it. The Abbot no longer answers my summons."

**Quest Hooks**:
- Can bless the party or provide minor healing
- Knows legends about the blessed pool and Sergei's spirit
- Will perform funeral rites if Ilya dies

**AI Behavior Notes**: Father Andrei is a spiritual guide, not a warrior. He provides moral support and local lore. He can cast minor healing spells but is not a combat cleric. Represents the fading hope of Krezk.

**Full Profile**: `game-data/npcs/father-andrei.yaml` (to be created in Stories 4-7 to 4-10)

### Gatekeeper
- **npcId**: `krezk_gatekeeper`
- **Name**: Boris (the Gatekeeper)
- **Type**: Human (Guard)
- **Role**: Captain of the gate guard
- **Age**: 30s
- **Location**: Village Gates

**Personality**: Suspicious, gruff, duty-bound. Takes his responsibility as gatekeeper extremely seriously. Loyal to Dmitri and protective of Krezk's people. Will not compromise security for politeness.

**Appearance**: Stocky and muscular with a thick black beard. Wears chain mail under a heavy wool cloak. Armed with a longsword and crossbow. Face weathered by mountain winds and constant vigilance.

**Dialogue Snippets**:
- "Turn back. Krezk is closed to outsiders. No exceptions."
- "The Burgomaster makes the decision, not me. But I can tell you he won't grant entry without good reason."
- "We've lost good people to those who came through these gates with ill intent. Not happening again on my watch."

**Quest Hooks**:
- First point of contact for entering Krezk
- Might be convinced to pass message to Burgomaster if party has wine or urgent business
- Will defend gates fiercely if attacked

**AI Behavior Notes**: Boris is a veteran guard (CR 1/8 to 1/2). He follows Dmitri's orders absolutely. Party must convince him or Dmitri to gain entry. Can be intimidated but will call for reinforcements rather than backing down.

**Full Profile**: `game-data/npcs/boris-gatekeeper.yaml` (to be created in Stories 4-7 to 4-10)
