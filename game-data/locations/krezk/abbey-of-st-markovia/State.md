# Abbey of St. Markovia - Current State

## Abbey Status (Pre-Visit)

The Abbey of St. Markovia stands on the mountain above Krezk, silent and brooding. From the village below, it appears abandoned—no smoke from chimneys, no monks tending the grounds, no bells calling the faithful to prayer. But those who listen carefully on still nights hear other sounds: laughter that isn't quite human, the scrape of tools on stone, occasional screams.

The villagers of Krezk avoid the abbey. They no longer speak of it except in whispers. Once, it was their greatest source of pride—a monastery of healing where the Order of St. Markovia brought divine light to this cursed land. Sick pilgrims came from across Barovia seeking the order's miracles.

That was long ago. Now, only the Abbot remains.

## The Abbot's Domain

Within the abbey walls, the Abbot continues his work. He believes himself to be performing acts of divine mercy. The mongrelfolk—twisted, malformed humans with animal features and broken bodies—he calls his "children." He created them, he insists, to give them purpose. Before, they were merely deformed or diseased. Now, they serve a higher calling.

His greatest project nears completion: Vasilka. A bride for Count Strahd von Zarovich, constructed from the finest parts of deceased villagers, perfected through divine fleshcraft. The Abbot believes that if he can give Strahd a companion—someone to ease his loneliness and love—the count will release his grip on Barovia. The curse will lift. Everyone will be saved.

It is madness, of course. But the Abbot cannot see it. He is a deva, a celestial being of pure good who descended to Barovia centuries ago to heal and protect. But centuries of failure, of watching good souls corrupted and destroyed, twisted something in him. His goodness remained, but his judgment warped. Now he commits atrocities in the name of mercy, builds horrors in the service of love.

He is the most dangerous kind of villain: one who genuinely believes he's the hero.

## The Mongrelfolk

Twelve mongrelfolk inhabit the abbey, dwelling primarily in the north wing. They are the Belview family and others—villagers from Krezk and beyond whom the Abbot "improved" through fleshcrafting. Dog heads on human bodies, extra limbs, mismatched proportions, patches of fur, tails, animal features mixed with human.

Most retain their human minds, which makes their condition all the more torturous. They remember being human. They see what they've become. The Abbot assures them this is better—they have purpose now, they serve divine work. Some believe him out of desperation. Others simply have no alternative.

Otto and Zygfrek Belview serve as the Abbot's chief assistants. Otto is pathetically eager to please, desperate for the Abbot's approval. Zygfrek is more aggressive, protective of the abbey and suspicious of outsiders. Both would die for the Abbot, not out of love, but because he is all they have.

## Vasilka's Creation

In the south wing, in a workroom that smells of preservatives and divine magic, Vasilka takes shape. The Abbot has spent months—perhaps years—on her construction. She is assembled from the parts of deceased villagers, each piece chosen for its perfection. An artist's hand here, a dancer's legs there, a singer's throat, a beauty's face.

The stitching is flawless. The Abbot's divine power ensures the flesh knits seamlessly. When complete, Vasilka will be beautiful—eerily, uncannily beautiful. She will walk, speak, perhaps even feel. But she will not be human. She is a flesh golem, an artifice of meat and magic.

The Abbot treats her with tender care, speaking to her even though she cannot yet respond. He has prepared a bridal suite for her, acquired (or commissioned) a wedding dress, planned every detail of her presentation to Strahd. He imagines the count's gratitude, the curse lifting, Barovia saved.

It will not happen that way. Strahd, if he ever sees Vasilka, will be amused at best, contemptuous at worst. The Abbot's grand plan is built on a foundation of delusion.

## Exploration Hazards

For adventurers who approach the abbey:

**The Gate Stands Open**: The abbey's iron gate hangs ajar. No one guards it. The Abbot welcomes visitors—he has nothing to hide (in his mind) and is always eager to help those in need. This openness is somehow more unsettling than if the place were locked and fortified.

**Mongrelfolk Patrols**: The mongrelfolk move through the abbey, performing tasks. They are not immediately hostile but their appearance is horrifying. First encounters may trigger fear responses. They will flee or call for the Abbot if threatened.

**The Abbot's Hospitality**: If the party enters peacefully, the Abbot will greet them warmly. He offers healing, answers questions, shows genuine interest in their needs. He will not reveal Vasilka or the mongrelfolk's origins unless asked directly or the party discovers them. Even then, he speaks of his work with pride, seeing no wrong in it.

**Discovery and Revelation**: As the party explores, the true nature of the abbey reveals itself. The surgical tools, the preserved organs, the mongrelfolk's tragic awareness, Vasilka's stitched body. The Abbot's madness becomes undeniable.

**Moral Choices**: The party must decide how to respond. Attack the Abbot (extremely dangerous—CR 15 deva)? Try to reason with him (unlikely to succeed)? Accept his aid and ignore the horror (morally compromising)? Free the mongrelfolk (but what then)? Each choice has consequences.

## Current Priorities

**The Abbot's Focus**: Completing Vasilka. Obtaining a perfect wedding dress (may send party to Vallaki for this). Presenting his creation to Strahd. Continuing to "help" anyone who comes to him, in his twisted way.

**The Mongrelfolk's Existence**: Surviving. Obeying. Hoping, perhaps, that someone will free them—though most don't dare admit such hopes aloud.

**Vasilka's Awakening**: When the Abbot deems her complete, he will animate her. She will awaken confused, innocent, not understanding what or who she is. A tragic figure, never asked if she wanted to exist.

## Potential Outcomes

**If the Party Defeats the Abbot**:
- Mongrelfolk are freed but lost without purpose
- Vasilka's fate uncertain (still needs animation, or awakens parentless)
- Abbey becomes abandoned or repurposed
- Village trust may increase (abbey no longer threat) or decrease (what if party is as dangerous?)

**If the Party Helps the Abbot**:
- Moral compromise but potential benefits (healing, information)
- Enabling his delusions
- Eventually may witness presentation to Strahd (awkward/horrifying)

**If the Party Ignores the Abbey**:
- Abbot continues his work
- Eventually may attempt contact with Strahd
- Mongrelfolk remain enslaved
- Missed opportunities for loot, quests, lore

The Abbey of St. Markovia is a moral test as much as a location. There are no clean solutions here.
