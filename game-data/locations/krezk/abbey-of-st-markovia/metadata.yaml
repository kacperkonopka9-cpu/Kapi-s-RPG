notes: "Abbey is major dungeon location in Krezk with moral complexity. The Abbot is CR 15 deadly encounter but can also be quest giver/healer. Mongrelfolk add tragic element. Vasilka represents Abbot's madness. Multiple resolution paths: combat, negotiation, ignoring. Requires party to make difficult moral choices."
