# Abbey of St. Markovia - Description

## Overview

The Abbey of St. Markovia crowns the mountain slope above Krezk, a sprawling monastery complex that once served as Barovia's beacon of healing and hope. Stone walls enclose courtyards and buildings constructed centuries ago by the Order of St. Markovia, who sought to bring divine light to this cursed land. Now the abbey stands as a monument to corrupted benevolence—its master, the Abbot, has fallen into madness disguised as mercy.

The main building is a massive stone structure with a central hall, north and south wings, and upper floors accessible by creaking staircases. Gothic windows, once radiant with stained glass, now stand dark or broken. The bell tower looms above, its bell occasionally tolling of its own accord. Beneath the abbey lie catacombs where the order's founders rest—or once rested.

## Initial Description

The mountain path winds steeply upward from Krezk, eventually opening onto a plateau where the Abbey of St. Markovia commands the landscape. High stone walls, weathered by centuries of mountain storms, encircle the compound. An iron gate hangs slightly ajar, creaking in the wind—unguarded, uninviting, yet not quite forbidding entry.

Beyond the gate, an overgrown courtyard spreads before the abbey's main entrance. Weeds push through cobblestones. A dry fountain stands at the center, its basin cracked, its carved angels worn faceless by time and neglect. The monastery building itself is imposing—three stories of gray stone with a slate roof and that bell tower rising like an accusing finger toward the perpetually overcast sky.

The windows are dark. Some are broken, others boarded from within. No smoke rises from chimneys. No monks tend the grounds. The only signs of habitation are strange, discordant sounds that drift from within: laughter that doesn't quite sound human, the scrape of something heavy being dragged across stone floors, and occasionally, screams that cut off abruptly.

From somewhere inside comes singing—a beautiful, angelic voice that makes your skin crawl because it shouldn't exist in a place like this.

## Return Description

The abbey gate stands as you left it, creaking on its hinges. The courtyard remains overgrown and lifeless, the fountain dry. The building looms as it always has, but now you know what horrors it contains.

The sounds from within have become familiar—the baying of the mongrelfolk, the Abbot's serene voice humming as he works, the clang of tools on flesh and bone. If you've disturbed his work, the atmosphere may have shifted—hostile, watchful, the windows no longer empty but filled with misshapen faces observing your approach.

If the Abbot has been defeated, the abbey stands silent and empty, its remaining inhabitants confused and lost, awaiting some new purpose or master that may never come.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Mountain sunrise touches the abbey's bell tower first, bathing it in cold light that does nothing to warm the stone. The gate casts long shadows across the courtyard. From within, the Abbot's voice rises in morning prayers—beautiful, holy-sounding words twisted by the knowledge of what he's become.

The mongrelfolk stir in their quarters, their misshapen forms visible briefly through windows before they retreat from the daylight that pains them.

### Night

After dark, the abbey becomes more active. Candlelight flickers in upper windows. Shadows move behind broken panes—shapes that are almost human but not quite. The mongrelfolk emerge to patrol the grounds, their hunched forms and uneven gaits making them easy to spot even in darkness.

From the abbey's interior comes the sound of the Abbot at work—surgical tools clinking, Vasilka's voice (if she speaks), and the wet sounds of flesh being reshaped. The bell in the tower sometimes tolls, though no hand pulls the rope.

## Points of Interest

### Main Hall
Large central chamber with vaulted ceiling. Once used for worship, now the Abbot's receiving area. Stone benches line the walls, covered in dust. A statue of St. Markovia stands at the far end, its face turned away as if in shame. Door to north wing (mongrelfolk quarters), south wing (storage, kitchens), and stairs to upper floors.

### North Wing - Mongrelfolk Quarters
Cramped cells and common areas where the Abbot's "children" dwell. The mongrelfolk are humans twisted by the Abbot's experiments—heads of animals, extra limbs, malformed bodies. They obey the Abbot absolutely. Otto and Zygfrek Belview are the most capable and serve as the Abbot's assistants. The wing smells of unwashed bodies and fear.

### South Wing - Storage and Kitchens
Abandoned storage rooms, a kitchen with cold hearths, and workrooms where the Order once prepared medicines. Now filled with surgical equipment, vials of strange fluids, and preserved organs in jars. This is where the Abbot conducts his most grotesque work—the construction of Vasilka.

### Upstairs - Abbot's Quarters
The upper floor houses the Abbot's personal chambers. Luxurious by monastery standards—a proper bed, writing desk, religious texts, and disturbingly, wedding clothes prepared for Vasilka. A window overlooks Krezk below. If the Abbot is here, he may be found in prayer, reading, or gazing out at the village with genuine but misguided concern for their souls.

### Vasilka's Room
A chamber prepared as a bridal suite. Vasilka herself—if construction is complete—may be found here. She is a flesh golem constructed from the parts of deceased villagers and "perfected" by the Abbot's twisted craftsmanship. Beautiful in an uncanny way. If she speaks, her voice is gentle and confused. She does not understand what she is.

### Bell Tower
Accessible via a ladder from the upper floor. The bell hangs silent until some force—divine, profane, or simply wind—sets it ringing. Climbing here grants a view of all Krezk, the valley below, and even distant Castle Ravenloft on clear days. Also, a good place to spot approaching visitors or threats.

### Catacombs
Beneath the abbey, stone passages lead to burial chambers where the Order of St. Markovia's founders rest. Sarcophagi line the walls, most undisturbed. Some bear signs of desecration—lids ajar, bodies missing. The Abbot has used some remains as materials for his creations. A cold, holy presence still lingers here, the last remnant of the abbey's original sanctity.

### Courtyard
Open area within the walls. Overgrown, neglected. Dry fountain at center. Provides space for outdoor encounters, assembly of mongrelfolk, or combat with the Abbot if he takes flight. Iron gate to mountain path and Krezk below.
