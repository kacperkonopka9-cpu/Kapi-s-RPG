notes: "Krezk is the most isolated and defensive settlement in Barovia. Entry requires Burgomaster's approval or bringing much-needed supplies (wine). Village operates on trust system (0-10 scale). Ilya's condition is time-sensitive quest hook. Abbey represents major dungeon location with fallen deva boss (CR 15). Blessed pool is key location for Ireena/Sergei storyline."
