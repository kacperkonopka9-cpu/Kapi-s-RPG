# Village of Krezk - Current State

## Village Status (Pre-Visit)

The Village of Krezk remains isolated and closed, its thick stone walls keeping the world at bay—and its people trapped within their fear. The single gatehouse stands guarded day and night, the heavy doors shut against strangers and the darkness that prowls Barovia's roads.

Within the walls, two hundred souls endure rather than live. They gather at the Shrine of the White Sun for prayers, tend their goats and meager crops, and speak in hushed voices about the Abbey that looms above them. Few venture out except when absolutely necessary. The village square sits empty most days, save for the occasional guard patrol.

## The Burgomaster's Crisis

In the Burgomaster's house, Dmitri Krezkov sits at his son's bedside, watching the boy fade. Ilya has been ill for weeks now—no fever, no visible injury, simply a wasting away as if life itself is draining from him. Anna Krezkova has not left the house in days, refusing to eat, refusing to sleep, spending every moment at Ilya's side.

Dmitri has tried everything. He brought healers from what little Krezk could offer. He sent messengers to the Abbey, begging the Abbot for help. The Abbot's response was cryptic: "The boy's illness is beyond mortal concern. Tend to matters of the living." What did that mean? Is Ilya cursed? Is this Strahd's doing?

The Burgomaster's hair has turned grayer in these weeks. His hands shake when he thinks no one is watching. He prays, but the Morninglord seems distant. If someone doesn't help soon—someone with magic, with divine power, with answers—Ilya will die. And Dmitri fears what he might become without his son.

## The Abbey's Shadow

Above the village, the Abbey of St. Markovia stands silent. Once it was a place of healing, where the faithful came for succor and the wounded for mercy. The Abbot was a figure of hope, performing miracles that defied the darkness.

But something changed. Years ago—decades perhaps, time blurs in this cursed land—the Abbot stopped receiving visitors. The monks disappeared or transformed into... something else. Strange sounds echo from the Abbey at night: screams, laughter, the baying of tortured things. The Abbot still lives there, still claims to heal, but his miracles have become grotesque parodies.

Few villagers dare approach the Abbey now. Those who do return changed, speaking in hushed tones about "the Abbot's children" and experiments that twist flesh and spirit alike. Father Andrei no longer climbs the mountain path. Even Dmitri, desperate as he is, hesitates to knock on those Abbey doors.

The village has learned to live with the Abbey looming over them—present but untouchable, like a second curse layered atop Strahd's.

## The Blessed Pool

At the base of the village walls, where mountain runoff collects in a natural basin, lies Krezk's one true miracle: the blessed pool. The water here is crystal clear, untainted by the corruption that seeps through Barovia's soil. It's said the Morninglord himself blessed this spring, or perhaps Sergei's spirit protects it—the villagers' stories differ.

Father Andrei tends the pool, blessing it weekly, ensuring pilgrims approach with reverence. The water heals minor ailments and grants clarity of spirit. Some whisper it can do more—bring the dead back to life, cleanse curses, manifest divine visions. But those are legends, aren't they?

No one has tested the pool's greater powers in living memory. Perhaps because to do so would risk breaking the one pure thing Krezk possesses. Perhaps because the villagers fear what they might learn—that even the blessed pool cannot save them from this land's curse.

## Village Mood

The people of Krezk are afraid. Not the sharp terror of immediate danger, but the grinding fear of slow inevitability. They know Strahd rules this land. They know the Abbey watches from above. They know the walls cannot hold forever.

So they pray. They close their gates. They trust no one beyond their immediate neighbors. They endure.

And they wait for something—anything—to change.

## Upcoming Concerns

**Ilya's Condition (Critical)**: The boy has perhaps a week left, maybe less. If the party arrives with healing magic or knowledge, they may save him. If not, his death will break the Burgomaster and send ripples through the village's fragile stability.

**Wine Shortage**: Krezk has not received a wine delivery from the Wizard of Wines winery in over a month. Father Andrei requires wine for religious sacraments. Without it, the ceremonies that hold the village together grow hollow.

**Gate Security**: Boris the Gatekeeper has orders to admit no one without Dmitri's explicit approval. Getting past him requires either proof of good intent (wine delivery, healing help, legitimate business) or force. The latter would make the party enemies of Krezk permanently.

**The Abbot's Designs**: Unbeknownst to the villagers below, the Abbot is near completion of his masterwork: Vasilka, a flesh golem bride intended as a gift for Strahd. If he succeeds, he believes Strahd will be appeased and release his grip on Barovia. The Abbot's mad benevolence may doom them all.
