# Blessed Pool - Description

## Overview
Natural spring at the base of Krezk's walls where crystal-clear water collects in a stone basin. The only untainted water source in Barovia, said to be blessed by the Morninglord or protected by Sergei's spirit.

## Initial Description
At the base of Krezk's stone walls, mountain runoff collects in a natural pool surrounded by smooth stones. The water is impossibly clear—you can see every pebble at the bottom. Unlike the murky streams and tainted wells elsewhere in Barovia, this water sparkles with purity. A faint warmth radiates from it, and the air nearby feels lighter, cleaner. Stone steps lead down to the water's edge. Offerings lie scattered around—flowers, coins, prayers carved into wooden tokens.

## Return Description
The blessed pool remains as pristine as before. Its waters continue to flow clear and pure, untouched by the corruption that seeps through this land.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Sunrise touches the pool first, making the water glow golden. Villagers come at dawn to draw water, approaching with reverence. Father Andrei performs morning blessings here weekly.

### Night
By moonlight, the pool seems to glow with its own light. On clear nights, if one gazes into the still water, visions may appear—Sergei's face, Tatyana's silhouette, glimpses of Barovia before the curse.
