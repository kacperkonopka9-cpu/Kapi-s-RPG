# Amber Temple - Current State

## First Approach

The Amber Temple looms in the distance, a monument to forbidden knowledge and ancient evil. Few who enter emerge unchanged—whether corrupted by dark gifts, slain by guardians, or driven mad by the whispers of imprisoned vestiges.

The party stands at a crossroads. Within these frozen halls lie answers about Strahd's origin, powerful artifacts, and knowledge that could tip the balance in the final confrontation. But the price of such power is steep. Every gift accepted, every bargain struck, every secret uncovered carries a cost measured in corruption, sanity, and soul.

## Environmental Conditions

- **Temperature**: Extreme cold (2d6 damage per hour without magical protection)
- **Atmosphere**: Oppressive psychic pressure, constant whispers from vestiges
- **Lighting**: Dim amber glow from sarcophagi, otherwise dark
- **Magic**: Vestiges radiate powerful necromantic and transmutation auras
- **Danger Level**: Extreme (CR 12-15 encounters, environmental hazards, corruption risk)

## Current Threats

- **Flameskulls**: CR 4 guardians patrolling corridors, rejuvenate unless killed with holy water
- **Exethanter**: CR 14 lich (non-hostile unless provoked)
- **Arcanaloth**: CR 12 vault guardian (negotiable but dangerous)
- **Vilnius**: CR 15 mummy lord (dormant in catacombs, lethal if awakened)
- **Undead Patrols**: Wights and mummies in catacombs
- **The Vestiges**: Imprisoned god-like entities offering dark gifts (corruption risk)
- **Environmental Hazards**: Extreme cold, psychic pressure, thin air, unstable ice

## Active Vestiges

The temple contains 12 amber sarcophagi housing vestiges:

**Main Chambers:**
- **Vampyr** (Amber Sanctum): Source of vampirism, cursed Strahd
- **Seriach** (Shrine): Hell Hound Whisperer, offers fire immunity
- **Talos** (Shrine): Storm Lord, offers lightning powers
- **Yrrga** (Shrine): Eye of Shadow, offers darkvision
- **Savnok** (Shrine): The Inscrutable, offers AC bonus

**Secondary Chambers:**
- Eight additional vestiges in various chambers, each offering unique dark gifts

## Known Resources

- **The Vault**: Contains 50,000+ gp in treasure plus magic items (guarded by arcanaloth)
- **Library**: Ancient tomes, Exethanter's spellbook, arcane knowledge
- **Exethanter's Laboratory** (hidden): Ritual to reverse dark gifts
- **Frozen Corpses**: Previous seekers' equipment (requires thawing)
- **Vilnius's Chamber**: Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning (guarded by CR 15 mummy lord)

## Available Allies

- **Exethanter**: The mad lich may become ally if memories restored (requires *Greater Restoration* ×3)
- **The Eternal Flame**: Central shrine's purification mechanism (meditation grants resistance to corruption)

## Corruption Mechanics

Accepting dark gifts grants power but carries severe costs:

**Corruption Levels:**
- **0 gifts**: Clean, no corruption
- **1 gift**: Minor physical mutation, social penalties
- **2 gifts**: Moderate corruption, alignment shift begins
- **3+ gifts**: Severe mutations, personality changes, potential loss of character control

**Reversal Options:**
- Ritual in Exethanter's hidden laboratory (1,000 gp, 8 hours, DC 18 Constitution save, painful)
- Meditation by Eternal Flame (grants advantage on saves to resist further gifts)
- *Greater Restoration* partially suppresses symptoms but doesn't remove gift

## Strategic Considerations

**For Parties Level 9-12:**
This is appropriate challenge. Guardians are tough but beatable. Environmental hazards manageable with preparation. Dark gifts tempting but party has resources to resist.

**For Parties Level 7-8:**
Very dangerous. CR 12+ encounters may be deadly. Environmental hazards severe. Dark gifts extremely tempting as "power boost" to reach competitive level with Strahd.

**For Parties Level 13+:**
Still challenging due to dark gift temptation and environmental hazards, but guardians less threatening. Vault treasure less impactful. Focus shifts to moral choices rather than survival.

## Notes

The Amber Temple represents the campaign's moral crucible. The power to defeat Strahd may lie within these walls—but accepting that power means risking becoming like him. Characters who enter must choose: Stay true to themselves and face Strahd under-powered, or embrace corruption and gain the strength to triumph.

Some parties will leave the temple unchanged, having resisted all temptations. Others will emerge powerful but transformed, bearing the physical marks of their bargains. A few will accept Vampyr's gift and become vampires themselves—rivals to Strahd or his potential successors.

The temple remembers all who enter. The vestiges are patient. They have waited millennia for freedom, and they will wait millennia more if necessary. Every visitor is another chance at escape, another soul to corrupt, another step toward their ultimate goal: breaking free of their amber prisons and reshaping reality itself.
