# Amber Temple - Description

## Overview

The Amber Temple is a frozen monument to forbidden knowledge, built millennia ago to imprison evil vestiges—dark god-like entities whose power corrupts all who seek it. This massive structure sits high in the Balinok Mountains, carved from black marble and amber, radiating an aura of ancient malevolence. The temple offers dark gifts to those desperate or foolish enough to accept them, trading power for corruption of body and soul.

Within its frozen halls, amber sarcophagi contain the vestiges—entities too dangerous to destroy but too powerful to allow freedom. Each offers a bargain: accept our gift, gain immense power, pay a terrible price. The temple also houses a lich named Exethanter, once a guardian, now a mad custodian who barely remembers his purpose.

## Initial Description

The Amber Temple emerges from mountain fog like a nightmare made stone. Black marble walls rise hundreds of feet, carved with bas-reliefs depicting cosmic horrors and fallen civilizations. Massive amber windows glow with sickly light from within. The structure radiates cold beyond natural winter—an unnatural chill that seeps into bones and souls alike.

The main entrance features massive bronze doors, partially buried in snow and ice. Above the doors, an inscription in Draconic warns: *"Seek not the secrets of the gods, lest ye become as they—eternal, damned, alone."*

Inside, the temperature plummets further. Ice coats every surface. Frozen corpses of previous seekers lie preserved in alcoves, their faces twisted in expressions of terror or ecstasy—impossible to tell which. The air itself feels wrong, thick with ancient magic and malevolent whispers.

## Return Description

The temple remembers those who enter. On subsequent visits, the whispers grow louder, more insistent. Vestiges already encountered call out by name, offering "better bargains" or warning of rivals' deceptions. The frozen halls seem to shift, revealing new chambers or concealing familiar ones, as if the temple itself reshapes to the desires and fears of visitors.

If dark gifts have been accepted, the corruption manifests visibly: shadows that move wrong, whispers only the corrupted can hear, physical mutations becoming more pronounced.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Daylight offers no comfort to the Amber Temple. The structure's amber windows filter sunlight into sickly yellow-green illumination that makes everything appear diseased. The main halls are marginally more visible, but the unnatural cold and oppressive atmosphere remain unchanged. Flameskulls and other guardians are equally active day and night—this place knows no circadian rhythm.

### Night
At night, the amber sarcophagi glow brighter, pulsing with the vestiges' alien consciousness. The whispers intensify. Temperature drops another 10 degrees. This is when vestiges are most active, most persuasive, most dangerous. Exethanter wanders the halls, muttering to himself about duties long forgotten.

## Major Areas

### Entrance Hall
A vast chamber with 40-foot ceilings. Ice chandeliers hang overhead. Frozen statues flank the entryway—ancient wizards who built this place, now monuments to hubris. The floor is polished black marble with amber inlay forming arcane circles. Three passages lead deeper: north to the library, east to the shrine, west to the vault.

### The Library
Shelves of ice-preserved books stretch into darkness. Most are ruined, but some contain genuine arcane knowledge. Exethanter's "study" occupies the library's center—a desk surrounded by scattered notes, failed spell components, and books he's read a thousand times yet no longer understands. The lich himself often lingers here, harmless unless threatened, offering cryptic warnings to visitors.

### Shrine of Forbidden Light
This chamber houses four amber sarcophagi containing lesser vestiges. Each glows with internal radiance. Approaching a sarcophagus triggers the vestige's telepathic contact—seductive whispers, promises of power, demands for acceptance. DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist touching the sarcophagus and hearing the full offer.

**Vestiges Present**:
- **Seriach** (the Hell Hound Whisperer): Offers immunity to fire and command over hell hounds. Price: permanent smoke pours from eyes and mouth.
- **Talos** (the Storm Lord): Offers lightning resistance and ability to cast *Lightning Bolt* once per day. Price: permanent static electricity, metal items shock allies.
- **Yrrga** (the Eye of Shadow): Offers Darkvision 120 ft. and see invisibility at will. Price: eyes become pure black voids, sunlight sensitivity.
- **Savnok** (the Inscrutable): Offers +2 AC and proficiency in all armor types. Price: face becomes featureless—no eyes, nose, or mouth (can somehow still perceive and breathe).

### The Vault
A treasure chamber containing accumulated wealth from millennia of failed expeditions. The vault is guarded by an arcanaloth (CR 12) who serves as accountant and guardian. The arcanaloth is willing to bargain but drives cruel bargains—access to treasure in exchange for service to the vestiges, information about Strahd in exchange for accepting a dark gift, safe passage in exchange for a magical item.

Contents: 15,000 gp in mixed currency, 30 gems worth 500 gp each, 8 art objects worth 2,500 gp each, 1d4 magic items (DM choice).

### Catacombs
Beneath the main temple, frozen crypts hold the preserved bodies of wizards who built this place. Some have risen as mummies or wights, guarding the lower levels. The catacombs connect to the Amber Sanctum—the temple's darkest chamber.

### The Amber Sanctum
The temple's heart: a vast chamber dominated by a single massive amber sarcophagus containing the most powerful vestige—**Vampyr**, the entity that created the first vampire and cursed Strahd von Zarovich to undeath. This sarcophagus radiates overwhelming malevolence.

Approaching Vampyr triggers DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. Failure means the party member hears Vampyr's offer: become a true vampire with all the power and none of Strahd's limitations. Price: lose your soul, serve Vampyr's unknowable cosmic agenda, spread vampirism across all worlds.

**Accepting this gift creates a rival to Strahd—or a player character's tragic downfall.**

Flameskulls (CR 4) guard this chamber, attacking intruders regardless of whether they interact with Vampyr.

### Vilnius's Chamber
A side chamber holds a sarcophagus containing Vilnius, a mummy lord (CR 15) who was once the temple's high priest. If disturbed, Vilnius awakens and attacks. His chamber contains the *Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning*—an artifact so dangerous even the vestiges fear it.

### Golem Workshop
An ancient chamber where temple builders created arcane guardians. Two deactivated flesh golems stand in alcoves. If combat erupts nearby, they activate and attack all living creatures indiscriminately. Their creator's workbenches contain golem manuals, arcane diagrams, and failed experiments (some horrifying).

## Secret Areas

### The Lost Wing
DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) reveals a hidden passage to the temple's abandoned eastern wing. This section was sealed after a vestige nearly escaped its prison. The wing contains:
- Broken amber sarcophagi (vestige escaped or destroyed)
- More powerful magic items (risk vs. reward)
- Evidence of the temple's true purpose: containing threats to the entire multiverse

### Exethanter's True Laboratory
Hidden beneath his library study, Exethanter's real research chamber contains his notes from before he lost his memories. Reading these notes reveals:
- The vestiges' true nature (entities from before creation)
- The wizards' folly (believing they could control cosmic evil)
- A ritual to reverse dark gifts (possible redemption path)
- Warnings about Vampyr specifically

## Points of Interest

### Amber Sarcophagi
Throughout the temple, these glowing prison-tombs contain vestiges. Each offers dark gifts—mechanical power-ups with steep narrative/physical costs. Total of 12 sarcophagi across all chambers, with Vampyr's being the most dangerous.

### Frozen Bodies
Hundreds of corpses line the halls—adventurers, wizards, treasure hunters who died of cold, guardian attacks, or the corruption of dark gifts they accepted. Their gear is frozen to their bodies (treasure if thawed carefully).

### The Eternal Flame
In the central shrine, a magical flame burns without consuming fuel. This is the temple's original purification mechanism, designed to resist vestige corruption. Characters who meditate by the flame (1 hour, DC 15 Wisdom check) can attempt to resist dark gifts they've already accepted—painful but potentially redemptive.

### Arcane Inscriptions
Walls throughout the temple bear warnings, rituals, and lore in Draconic, Abyssal, Infernal, and Celestial. Translating these provides crucial information about vestige weaknesses, dark gift consequences, and the temple's history.

## Environmental Hazards

- **Extreme Cold**: 2d6 cold damage per hour without magical protection (*Ring of Warmth*, *Endure Elements*, etc.)
- **Vestige Corruption**: Each dark gift accepted increases corruption—physical mutations, alignment shifts, mental instability
- **Thin Air**: High altitude causes exhaustion on failed Constitution saves
- **Psychic Pressure**: Near sarcophagi, DC 13 Wisdom saves or take 1d6 psychic damage from vestige mental contact

## Strategic Notes

The Amber Temple is designed for level 9-12 parties. Lower level parties will struggle with the guardians (arcanaloth, flameskulls, mummies) and the environmental hazards. The dark gifts tempt desperate characters—those who feel underpowered for facing Strahd might accept corruption for the strength to challenge him.

This creates dramatic choice: Accept vestige corruption and become powerful enough to defeat Strahd, but lose part of yourself in the process? Or refuse the gifts, stay true to yourself, and risk failure?
