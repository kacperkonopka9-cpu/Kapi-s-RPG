lore_significance: |
  The Amber Temple predates Strahd by millennia. It was built by an ancient order of wizards who discovered
  entities from before creation—vestiges whose very existence threatened reality. Unable to destroy these
  god-like beings, the wizards imprisoned them in amber sarcophagi, building a temple to contain and guard
  them for eternity.

  The irony is profound: The temple built to prevent cosmic evil from corrupting the world became the
  source of Barovia's greatest evil. Strahd came here centuries ago, desperate for power to win Tatyana's
  love. He accepted Vampyr's dark gift, becoming the land's first vampire. His curse spawned from this
  place.

  Now the temple offers the same choice to all who enter: Accept power and corruption, or refuse and remain
  pure but potentially too weak to defeat the vampire lord.

dm_notes: |
  The Amber Temple is the campaign's moral climax before the final confrontation. Players will be tempted—
  some severely. Dark gifts offer genuine mechanical advantages:

  - Vampyr's gift makes a character a full vampire (massive power boost, massive narrative cost)
  - Other gifts provide benefits equivalent to very rare magic items
  - Parties feeling under-leveled for Strahd may see dark gifts as necessary

  Key DM considerations:
  1. Make temptations genuine (don't present only "bad" options)
  2. Make consequences real (physical mutations manifest, NPCs react with fear)
  3. Provide redemption path (reversal ritual exists but is costly and painful)
  4. Track corruption carefully (each gift increases corruption level)

  Exethanter is the heart of the temple's tragedy. He's been alone for millennia, watching seekers corrupt
  themselves or die, unable to help because he can't remember why he's there. If the party shows him
  compassion, he becomes invaluable ally. If they attack him, he's a CR 14 lich boss fight.

  The arcanaloth creates fascinating negotiation scenarios. It knows everything, guards immense treasure,
  and will bargain—but it drives cruel bargains. Players who outsmart it or strike favorable deals will
  feel accomplished. Those who refuse to deal must fight or sneak.

  Vilnius is pure optional boss content. The Tarrasque scroll is so dangerous it should be locked behind
  a CR 15 encounter. Only desperate or very confident parties should attempt this.
