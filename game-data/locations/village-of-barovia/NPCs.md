# NPCs in Village of Barovia

## Ireena Kolyana
- **Type:** Human Noble
- **Age:** 26
- **Location:** Burgomaster's Mansion
- **Status:** Alive, Fearful (Orphaned if burgomaster dies)
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (will become Ally)
- **Quest Connection:** Main Quest - Strahd's Obsession / Escort Ireena to Safety
- **Full Profile:** game-data/npcs/ireena_kolyana.yaml

### Description
Ireena is a striking young woman with auburn hair and haunting green eyes that seem perpetually shadowed by exhaustion. She wears a simple but well-made dress in deep blue, though it's torn at the hem and dusted with ash. Two puncture marks on her neck—barely healed—mark Strahd's unwanted attention. Despite her fear, she carries herself with quiet dignity and fierce determination. Dark circles under her eyes speak of sleepless nights.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "You're not from Barovia, are you? I can see it in your eyes—you still have hope. I pray that Strahd does not extinguish it."
- **Quest Hook:** "My father is dying. He has protected me from... from HIM for so long, but now Father is too weak. When he's gone, nothing will stop Strahd from taking me. Please, my brother Ismark and I need help moving Father's body to the church for burial. And then... and then I must leave this cursed place."
- **If Father Alive:** "Father forbids me to leave the house. He says it's not safe, that Strahd is watching. He's right, of course. Strahd is always watching."
- **If Father Dead:** "The nightmare isn't over. Strahd will come for me again. He always does. I must reach the Abbey in Krezk—perhaps the Abbot can protect me where my father could not."

### Stats

## Ismark Kolyanovich (Ismark the Lesser)
- **Type:** Human Fighter (Former Soldier)
- **Age:** 24
- **Location:** Blood of the Vine Tavern / Burgomaster's Mansion
- **Status:** Alive, Desperate
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (seeking help)
- **Quest Connection:** Escort Ireena Quest / Bury the Burgomaster
- **Full Profile:** game-data/npcs/ismark_kolyanovich.yaml

### Description
Ismark is a broad-shouldered young man with a thick beard and weary eyes. His clothes are well-worn but serviceable—leather armor over a simple shirt, a longsword at his hip. His hands are calloused from sword work, though he holds his blade with the desperation of a man who knows he's outmatched. Villagers call him "Ismark the Lesser" behind his back, a cruel nickname comparing him unfavorably to his father, but his determination to protect his sister is anything but lesser.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "Strangers? In Barovia? You must be mad or cursed—perhaps both. But if you're here... maybe the gods haven't forsaken us entirely."
- **Quest Hook:** "I need help. My father, the burgomaster, is dead. He gave everything to protect my sister Ireena from... from HIM. From Strahd. But I can't carry Father's body to the church alone, and I can't leave Ireena unguarded. Will you help us?"
- **At Tavern:** "I come here seeking aid, but the villagers won't meet my eyes. They fear Strahd's wrath if they help us. I can't blame them—they've seen what happens to those who defy him."
- **After Burial:** "Thank you for helping lay Father to rest. But the real task remains—getting Ireena to safety. Strahd has bitten her twice already. I fear the third time will be... final."

### Stats
- **AC:** 16 (chain shirt)
- **HP:** 30
- **Abilities:** STR 16, DEX 12, CON 14, INT 10, WIS 11, CHA 9

- **Relationship to Player:** Indifferent (lost in grief)
- **Quest Connection:** Tragic backstory (her daughter Gertruda)

### Description
Mary is a hollow shell of a woman, her hair wild and gray, her clothes ragged and stained with tears. Her eyes stare at nothing, and her voice never rises above a wail. She has not slept, eaten properly, or left her cottage in weeks. The villagers call her Mad Mary, though some remember when she was just Mary, before grief devoured her whole.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Response:** *Wails* "Gertruda! My daughter! Where is my Gertruda? The devil took her! STRAHD TOOK MY BABY!" *Collapses into sobbing*
- **If Pressed:** *Between sobs* "She was such a good girl... wanted to see the castle... I told her no... I TOLD HER NO... and she went anyway... she's gone... gone to him..."
- **No Coherent Quest:** Mary cannot provide directions or useful information—only grief.

## Father Donavich
- **Type:** Human Priest (Cleric)
- **Age:** 52
- **Location:** Village Church
- **Status:** Alive, Grief-Stricken, Exhausted
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (desperate for help)
- **Quest Connection:** His son Doru (vampire spawn in church basement)

### Description
Father Donavich is a haggard man in tattered priestly robes, his face gaunt from sleepless nights and endless prayers. His hands shake constantly, and his voice cracks when he speaks. Dark circles surround his red-rimmed eyes. He hasn't left the church in over a year—trapped between his duty to Barovia and his love for his damned son.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** *Startled* "What? Who— Oh, strangers? Forgive me. I was praying. Always praying. It's all I can do anymore."
- **About the Church:** "This church has stood for centuries, but its gods have long since abandoned us. I pray, yes, but I wonder if anyone is listening. Still, I must try. For the villagers. For... for my son."
- **Quest Hook:** *Voice breaking* "You may hear scratching from below. Voices. Screaming. That is my son, Doru. A year ago, he led a foolish revolt against Castle Ravenloft. He and his friends sought to destroy Strahd. They all died... but Doru came back. Wrong. Changed. He begs me for blood, and I... I cannot end him. He is my son. But I cannot feed him either. I keep him locked below and pray for a miracle that will never come."
- **After Helping with Doru:** *Tears* "Thank you. You've freed him from damnation. You've freed us both."

## Bildrath Cantemir
- **Type:** Human Merchant (Commoner)
- **Age:** 58
- **Location:** Bildrath's Mercantile (village general store)
- **Status:** Alive, Greedy
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (will trade but gouges prices)
- **Quest Connection:** None (merchant only)

### Description
Bildrath is a portly man with greasy gray hair, calculating eyes, and a permanent scowl. He wears a stained merchant's apron over threadbare but once-fine clothes. His fingers are thick and stubby, always twitching as if counting invisible coins. He speaks in a gravelly voice and never smiles—except when overcharging customers. Despite the village's poverty, Bildrath has grown fat on exploitation, justifying his outrageous prices with cold logic: "Supply and demand, friend. You won't find these goods anywhere else in Barovia."

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "Welcome to Bildrath's Mercantile, the finest—and only—general store in the Village of Barovia. You'll find my prices are... reflective of the current market conditions."
- **When Questioned About Prices:** "Two hundred percent markup? That's the cost of doing business in a cursed land, friend. If you don't like it, try your luck elsewhere. Oh wait—there IS nowhere else!" *Laughs coldly*
- **About the Village:** "The villagers are fools. They cower and pray instead of adapting. I've learned to prosper even in Strahd's shadow. Coin doesn't care who rules the land."
- **If Threatened:** *Backs away, calls for Parriwimple* "Parri! PARRI! We have trouble!" *Parriwimple emerges from the back room, knuckles cracking*

### Stats
- **AC:** 11 (padded armor under clothes)
- **HP:** 16
- **Abilities:** STR 9, DEX 10, CON 12, INT 14, WIS 11, CHA 8

- Will sell to anyone with coin, including Strahd's servants
- Cowardly in combat—relies on Parriwimple for protection
- Keeps a secret ledger of debts owed by villagers (blackmail material)
- Knows the value of everything and the worth of nothing

## Parriwimple
- **Type:** Human Commoner (Simpleton/Enforcer)
- **Age:** 32
- **Location:** Bildrath's Mercantile (usually in the back room or sweeping)
- **Status:** Alive, Simple-minded
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (follows Bildrath's orders)
- **Quest Connection:** None

### Description
Parriwimple is a massive, lumbering man with the mind of a child. He stands over six feet tall with broad shoulders and hands like hams. His face is slack and friendly, with a perpetual confused expression. He wears simple work clothes—always stained and torn from heavy labor. Despite his intimidating size, his eyes are gentle and confused. He speaks slowly and simply, often repeating what others say. Bildrath uses him as muscle and cheap labor, paying him in scraps and a place to sleep in the store's back room.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "H-hello. I'm Parriwimple. Uncle Bildrath says I help good. You need help?"
- **If Asked About His Work:** "I carry heavy things. Boxes. Barrels. Sometimes people if Uncle Bildrath says. I'm strong! See?" *Flexes arms proudly*
- **If Offered Kindness:** *Eyes widen with surprise and delight* "You... you're nice! Not many people nice to Parriwimple. Want to be friends?"
- **If Bildrath Calls for Help:** "Uncle needs me! I protect uncle!" *Moves to defend Bildrath, though clearly doesn't want to fight*

### Stats
- **AC:** 10
- **HP:** 26

- Craves friendship and kindness—starved for positive attention
- Can be easily bribed with food, especially sweets
- If befriended, might secretly give players discounts or extra supplies without Bildrath knowing
