# Village of Barovia - Current State

The Village of Barovia lies shrouded in its perpetual fog, unchanged for countless years. The burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich, clings to life in his barricaded mansion, his strength failing as he struggles to protect his daughter Ireena from Strahd's relentless pursuit. His son Ismark paces the streets desperately seeking help, but the terrified villagers avert their eyes—they know the cost of defying the vampire lord.

Mad Mary's wails echo through the empty streets, a constant reminder of the village's despair. Her daughter Gertruda has been missing for months, likely claimed by the castle. Father Donavin maintains a sleepless vigil in the church, torn between his sacred duty and the vampire spawn—his own son Doru—locked screaming in the basement below.

The Blood of the Vine Tavern serves watered wine to sullen patrons who drink in silence. Bildrath's Mercantile exploits desperate travelers with outrageous prices, the greedy merchant caring nothing for his neighbors' suffering. The gallows stands empty in the town square, but locals whisper that it won't stay empty long.

No one walks the streets at night. No children play. No hope remains.

This is the Village of Barovia, where souls come to wither and die.
