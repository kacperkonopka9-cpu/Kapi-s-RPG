## Current Time
Afternoon (14:30)

## Weather
Heavy fog reducing visibility to 30 feet, light drizzle, temperature 45°F. Oppressive gray sky with no visible sun. Wind carries the smell of damp earth and decay from Svalich Wood.

## Location Status
- **Burgomaster's Mansion:** Kolyan Indirovich is dying (bedridden, final days). Ireena keeps vigil at his bedside. Ismark paces frantically. House is barricaded against Strahd.
- **Blood of the Vine Tavern:** Open but nearly empty. Arik the barkeeper serves watered-down wine to 3 sullen villagers who refuse to speak. Ismark visits regularly seeking help—villagers avoid him.
- **Church:** Father Donavich inside, exhausted from praying. Doru (his vampiric son) locked in basement, screaming for blood. Church bell has been silent for over a year. Graveyard expanding rapidly.
- **Mad Mary's Cottage:** Mary has not stopped weeping for weeks. Villagers leave food at her door, which she barely touches. Her daughter Gertruda has been missing for months.
- **Village Streets:** Deserted except for hurried, hunched figures scurrying between buildings. No children playing. No laughter. Everyone avoids eye contact.

## Changes Since Last Visit
- Burgomaster's health has declined further—days or hours left
- Fresh grave in cemetery (young child, died of "wasting sickness")
- Zombie attack last week damaged 2 houses on north edge—owners have boarded them up and abandoned them
- Morgantha the peddler visited 2 days ago—sold 7 dream pastries, took one child in payment (family claims child "ran away")

## NPC Positions
- **Ireena Kolyana:** Burgomaster's Mansion, father's bedroom (tending to dying father, barely sleeping)
- **Ismark Kolyanovich:** Blood of the Vine Tavern during day (recruiting help), Burgomaster's Mansion at night (guarding Ireena)
- **Mad Mary:** Mary's Cottage (on floor, weeping)
- **Father Donavich:** Village Church (kneeling before altar, praying desperately)
- **Bildrath:** Bildrath's Mercantile (open for business, gouging desperate customers)
- **Arik the Barkeeper:** Blood of the Vine Tavern (serving drinks with dead eyes)
- **Villagers (47 total):** Scattered throughout homes and shops, all terrified and hopeless

## Active Quests
- **Bury the Burgomaster:** Not yet active (triggers when Kolyan dies). Ismark will need help carrying body to church and convincing Father Donavich to perform burial.
- **Escort Ireena to Safety:** Not yet active (triggers after burial). Ireena seeks passage to either Vallaki or Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk, anywhere away from Strahd's reach.
- **Rescue Doru (Implied):** Father Donavich has not explicitly asked for help, but his son Doru is a vampire spawn in the church basement. Donavich cannot bring himself to destroy his son but knows Doru must be stopped.
