# Events in Village of Barovia

## Scheduled Events

### Death of the Burgomaster
- **Trigger:** 3 days after player arrival OR player enters Burgomaster's Mansion for first time
- **Type:** Story Event
- **Effect:** Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich dies from heart failure (stress and exhaustion from protecting Ireena). Updates Ireena's status to "Orphaned," Ismark's status to "Desperate." Unlocks "Bury the Burgomaster" quest and "Escort Ireena to Safety" main quest. Body must be carried to church for burial.
- **Consequence:** If body is not buried within 7 days, Strahd reanimates Kolyan as a zombie to terrorize Ireena.

### Zombie Siege at the Village Gates
- **Trigger:** Calendar date 2024-03-15, 23:00 (night of full moon) OR if Ireena leaves village without escort
- **Type:** Combat Event
- **Effect:** 2d6 zombies (roll: 8 zombies) emerge from Svalich Wood and attack the village. Villagers bar their doors. Only player and Ismark defend if present. Combat lasts 30 minutes in-game.
- **Consequence:** If village is not defended, 1d4 villagers die (roll result: 2 villagers). Village population decreases, fear increases, and villagers become even more hostile to outsiders who "brought bad luck."

### Strahd's Visit
- **Trigger:** Player escorts Ireena out of village gates
- **Type:** Story Event (Non-Combat initially)
- **Effect:** Strahd von Zarovich appears on his nightmare steed at edge of village, blocking the road. He speaks to the party: "You think to steal her from me? How quaint. I have claimed Ireena twice already, and I will claim her a third time—when I am ready. But you interest me, stranger. I will allow this... for now. Let us see if you can protect her better than her father did. I do so enjoy watching mortals struggle against fate." He departs dramatically, leaving party shaken but alive. Ireena confirms: "He toyed with us. He always does."

## Conditional Events

### Doru Escapes the Church
- **Trigger:** Player opens church basement door without killing Doru OR Father Donavich dies
- **Type:** Combat Event / Horror Event
- **Effect:** Doru (vampire spawn) escapes and attacks the nearest living creature. If Donavich still lives, Doru attempts to feed on his father first (Donavich offers no resistance). After feeding, Doru flees to Ravenloft to serve Strahd. Donavich dies of blood loss and grief. Village becomes even more terrified.
- **Consequence:** Donavich's death weighs on player's conscience. Church remains abandoned. Villagers refuse to discuss what happened.

### Gertruda Returns
- **Trigger:** Player visits Castle Ravenloft OR 30 days pass
- **Type:** Story Event (Tragic)
- **Effect:** Gertruda (Mad Mary's daughter) returns to village as a vampire spawn, having been turned by Strahd. She approaches her mother's cottage at night. If player intervenes, combat ensues. If player does not intervene, Gertruda drains Mad Mary and flees. Mary dies smiling—finally reunited with her daughter.
- **Consequence:** Demonstrates Strahd's cruelty and the tragic fate of those who seek him out.

### Morgantha the Night Hag Visits
- **Trigger:** Morning after player arrives (repeats every 3 days)
- **Type:** Social Event / Horror Element
- **Effect:** Morgantha, disguised as an old peddler woman, sells "dream pastries" to villagers for 1 gp each (or in exchange for children—though this is not openly stated). Villagers eagerly buy them despite being addicted. Pastries grant euphoric dreams for 1d4 hours but are mildly addictive. Children who are "sold" are taken to Old Bonegrinder mill and made into pastries.
- **Consequence:** If player investigates, discovers horrifying truth about pastries. If player does nothing, village children disappear over time.

## Recurring Events
- **Daily Gloom:** Every morning, fog thickens and rolls through village streets. Visibility reduced to 30 feet until midday. Atmosphere.
- **Mary's Wailing:** Every evening at sunset, Mad Mary begins wailing for her lost daughter. Continues until midnight. Can be heard throughout village. Atmosphere / morale effect on villagers.
- **Wolf Howls:** Every night (9 PM - 5 AM), wolves howl from Svalich Wood. Villagers shudder and bar doors. Wolves do not attack village unless commanded by Strahd. Atmosphere / fear mechanic.
