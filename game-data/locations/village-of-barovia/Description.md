# Village of Barovia

## Overview
A grim, fog-shrouded village clinging to survival in Strahd's shadow. The Village of Barovia serves as the gateway to the cursed land, where hope has withered and fear rules the night. Wooden buildings lean against each other for support, their shutters closed tight even during daylight hours.

## Initial Description
The narrow dirt road transitions into a muddy street as you enter the Village of Barovia. Tightly clustered wooden buildings, their roofs sagging under years of neglect, crowd both sides of the street. Thick fog presses against the windows, and an oppressive silence hangs in the air—broken only by distant sobbing from somewhere within the village.

The few villagers you glimpse move like shadows, hunched and hurried, their eyes downcast. They wear threadbare clothes in shades of gray and brown, and none meet your gaze. The smell of wood smoke and damp earth permeates everything.

At the village center stands a dilapidated tavern, the Blood of the Vine, its sign creaking in an unfelt breeze. To the north, beyond the clustered buildings, you can make out the looming shape of a mansion. To the east, the broken spire of a church rises against the gray sky, its bell long silent.

The fog is so thick you can barely see the Svalich Wood surrounding the village, but you sense it there—waiting, watching. Welcome to Barovia, where the sun never quite breaks through the mist, and the night belongs to something far darker than shadow.

## Return Description
You return to the Village of Barovia. The fog still clings to the buildings, and the villagers still avoid eye contact. The air tastes of wood smoke and rain. You hear distant sobbing—Mad Mary's endless grief—and the creak of the Blood of the Vine's tavern sign. The village hasn't changed; it never changes. Only the weight of Strahd's presence feels heavier.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Pale gray light filters through the fog, but the sun remains invisible above the mist. The village should be waking, but few souls stir. Shutters remain closed. A rooster crows half-heartedly from somewhere near the tavern. The morning fog is thicker than ever, and you can see your breath even as the day supposedly begins.

### Night
True darkness falls over the Village of Barovia, and with it, a silence deeper than death. Every shutter is barred, every door bolted. No lights show in windows—as if the villagers fear drawing attention from the night itself. Wolves howl in the distance, impossibly close despite the Svalich Wood being miles away. The fog becomes almost solid in the darkness, pressing against you like cold fingers. Only fools and the damned walk the streets of Barovia after sunset.

### Foggy
The perpetual mist that shrouds the Village of Barovia occasionally thickens into an impenetrable fog so dense you can barely see your hand before your face. Visibility drops to mere feet. Buildings emerge from the gray void like ghost ships, their outlines distorted and menacing. Sound becomes muffled and strange—footsteps echo oddly, voices seem to come from wrong directions. You cannot tell if that shadow ahead is a building, a person, or something worse. The damp cold seeps through every layer of clothing, chilling you to the bone. In this heavy fog, the village feels utterly isolated from all reality, as if the mists have severed it from the world and trapped you in a pocket dimension of endless dread. Even the villagers refuse to venture out when the fog grows this thick, knowing that things move within it that should not be seen.
