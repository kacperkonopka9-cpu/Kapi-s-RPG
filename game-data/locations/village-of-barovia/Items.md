## Hidden Items (Requires Investigation)
- **Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (Fake):** DC 20 Investigation in Church ruins. A convincing replica, but powerless—the real symbol is hidden elsewhere. Worth 25 gp to a collector.
- **Burgomaster's Hidden Cache:** DC 15 Investigation in Burgomaster's Mansion bedroom. Contains 100 gp, 3 potions of healing, and a journal detailing Ireena's abductions by Strahd.
- **Mad Mary's Lost Ring:** DC 12 Perception in Mary's Cottage. A simple gold wedding band fallen between floorboards. Worth 10 gp, but returning it to Mary grants no response—she doesn't notice.
- **Donavich's Secret Stash:** DC 18 Investigation in Church cellar (near Doru). Wooden stakes (3), garlic (bundle), mirror (small silver), holy water (2 flasks). Tools Donavich gathered but could never bring himself to use against his son.
