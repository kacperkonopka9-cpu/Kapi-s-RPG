# Reformation Center

## Overview
The Baron's answer to "malcontentedness"—a squat stone building that serves as both guardhouse and political prison. Here, those who fail to smile enthusiastically enough are sent for "reformation" (imprisonment and intimidation).

## Initial Description
The Reformation Center stands at Vallaki's edge—a squat stone building with barred windows and a single iron-banded door. This is where those who fail to smile enthusiastically enough are sent for "reformation," the Baron's euphemism for imprisonment and intimidation.

The building serves dual purpose: guardhouse for town watch rotations and holding facility for perceived troublemakers. Inside, the main chamber holds weapon racks, a duty roster, and a stove that never quite keeps the cold at bay. Guard bunks line one wall, spartan and functional.

Beyond the main room, a heavy door leads to the cells—small, damp chambers with stone floors and iron bars. The air reeks of mildew and despair. Prisoners sit on wooden benches, their faces carefully neutral, knowing that any sign of sadness will only extend their stay. The guards themselves seem uncomfortable with their duty, avoiding eye contact with prisoners.

## Return Description
The Reformation Center looms before you again, unchanged. The same guards patrol the same halls, enforcing the same absurd edicts. New faces occupy the cells, guilty of crimes like "insufficient applause" or "failure to attend festival."

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning brings shift changes at the Reformation Center. Night watch guards stumble to their bunks, exhausted from hours of nervous vigilance. Day shift arrives, reviews the prisoner roster, and begins their rounds. Occasionally prisoners are released—always in time to attend the day's festival, always with warnings about future enthusiasm requirements. Sometimes new prisoners arrive, dragged in by Izek or his guards for yesterday's infractions.

### Night
Night at the Reformation Center is skeleton crew time—only two guards on duty, both tired and jumpy. The cells grow colder, darker. Prisoners huddle on their benches, trying to sleep while maintaining appropriately neutral expressions even in dreams. Beyond the walls, wolves howl. Inside, guards check locks repeatedly, knowing their weapons are useless against Barovia's true threats. The building offers no real protection, just the illusion of authority.
