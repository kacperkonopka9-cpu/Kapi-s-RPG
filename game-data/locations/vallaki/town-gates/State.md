# Town Gates - Current State

The gates of Vallaki stand open to the gray morning, guards posted at their stations scanning the roads for travelers. The watch captain reviews his ledger, noting yesterday's arrivals: refugees from the village of Barovia, a Vistani trader, and that peculiar entertainer with the wagon who's staying at the Blue Water Inn.

Tonight the gates will close again, as they do every night. The ritual brings comfort to the guards—a barrier between themselves and whatever hunts in the Barovian darkness.
