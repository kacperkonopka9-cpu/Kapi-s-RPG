# Town Gates

## Overview
Two fortified gates pierce Vallaki's palisade walls—East Gate facing Castle Ravenloft, West Gate toward Krezk. Heavily guarded during day, sealed at night. The town's first and last line of defense against the darkness.

## Initial Description
Two fortified gates pierce Vallaki's fifteen-foot palisade walls—the East Gate facing the Svalich Road toward Castle Ravenloft, and the West Gate opening toward the winery lands and Krezk beyond. Each gate consists of massive timber doors reinforced with iron bands, flanked by twenty-foot guard towers.

The gates stand open during daylight hours, but guards inspect all who enter. They question travelers about their business, their mood, and most importantly, their willingness to participate in the Baron's festivals. Those who fail to demonstrate sufficient enthusiasm may find themselves turned away—or worse, escorted directly to the reformation center.

From atop the guard towers, watchmen scan the surrounding lands. They watch for wolves, for Vistani bands, for refugees from other villages—and always, always, they watch for the mists that might herald Strahd's approach. Their vigilance is genuine, born not from loyalty to the Baron but from primal fear of what lurks beyond the walls.

## Return Description
You approach Vallaki's gates once more. The guards recognize you now—one less unknown to worry about. They wave you through with only cursory inspection, though they still watch to ensure your smile seems genuine enough.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Dawn breaks over Vallaki's gates at 6:00 AM sharp. Guards unbolt the massive wooden bars, and the gates grind open to admit the day's travelers. Farmers from outlying homesteads arrive with what produce they've managed to grow. Vistani traders come bearing goods. Refugees from other villages seek admission, their desperation making them willing to endure the Baron's madness. The watch captain reviews his entry ledger, noting all arrivals while scanning faces for potential troublemakers.

### Night
At 6:00 PM, horns sound from the guard towers. The massive timber gates grind closed with booming finality, heavy wooden bars dropping into place. Curfew descends upon Vallaki. Six guards take up night watch positions—three per gate, two in the towers, one at ground level. They're more nervous than their daytime counterparts, crossbows loaded, eyes scanning the darkness beyond the walls. Wolf howls echo from the forests. Mist creeps closer. And the guards pray that walls and locked gates will be enough.
