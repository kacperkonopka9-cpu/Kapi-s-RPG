# Blue Water Inn

## Overview
Urwin Martikov's welcoming inn serves as Vallaki's primary refuge for travelers—and one of the few places where genuine warmth exists. Behind its blue-painted facade, the inn serves as an informal quest hub where information flows as freely as the wine.

## Initial Description
The Blue Water Inn stands out in Vallaki not for garish decoration but for its genuine hospitality. The building's blue-painted exterior gives the establishment its name, and unlike the Baron's mandated colors, this paint job seems chosen from actual preference rather than decree.

Inside, a large common room welcomes guests with the smell of roasting meat, fresh bread, and Wizard of Wines vintages. A fire crackles in the hearth. Urwin Martikov works behind the bar, his easy manner and quick wit putting travelers at ease. His wife Danika manages the kitchen, their sons help where needed, and various guests occupy tables—including a mysterious well-dressed man named Rictavio who keeps a covered wagon in the stable yard.

Upstairs, guest rooms provide clean beds and actual privacy—luxuries in a town where the Baron's guards patrol everywhere. The inn's attic serves as storage, though Urwin sometimes meets there with his Keeper brethren when wereraven business demands secrecy.

## Return Description
You return to the Blue Water Inn, its familiar warmth a welcome contrast to Vallaki's forced cheer. Urwin greets you like an old friend, and the common room feels more like home than anywhere else in this cursed land.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning at the Blue Water Inn means fresh bread, strong coffee, and Danika's hearty breakfast. Urwin wipes down tables and chats with overnight guests, gathering news and gossip. The stable boy tends to Rictavio's mysterious covered wagon, careful not to get too close—something inside growls occasionally. Local workers stop by for morning meals before heading to their trades.

### Night
Evening transforms the inn into Vallaki's social center. The common room fills with locals seeking refuge from the Baron's madness, travelers sharing road stories, and Urwin dispensing advice along with drinks. A bard sometimes plays (though never loudly enough to draw guard attention). Upstairs, Rictavio retires early to his room, locking the door and speaking to no visitors. In the stable, that covered wagon rocks occasionally, and low growls echo in the darkness.
