# Blue Water Inn - Current State

The Blue Water Inn operates as Vallaki's most welcoming establishment. Urwin Martikov serves travelers with genuine warmth, his secret wereraven nature known only to his family. Rictavio entertains guests with carnival stories while guarding his wagon's dangerous secret. The inn serves as an unlikely hub for those who would resist Strahd—if they can be trusted.
