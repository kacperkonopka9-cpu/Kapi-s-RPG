# Coffin Maker's Shop - Current State

Henrik's shop operates as it always has—a place of death and carpentry, of coffins crafted for Vallaki's dead. But beneath the surface, terrible secrets hide: sacred bones stolen and concealed, vampire spawn nesting upstairs, a terrified craftsman caught in Strahd's web.

The shop is a ticking clock. Three days since the bones were stolen. If they're not returned to the church by tonight, St. Andral's Feast will begin—and Vallaki will pay the price for Henrik's cowardice.
