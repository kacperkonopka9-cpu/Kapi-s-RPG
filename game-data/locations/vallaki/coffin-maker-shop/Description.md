# Coffin Maker's Shop

## Overview
Henrik van der Voort's coffin maker's shop occupies a two-story building on a quiet side street. The smell of fresh-cut wood masks darker secrets: St. Andral's stolen bones hidden in the workshop, and vampire spawn nesting upstairs.

## Initial Description
The smell hits you first—fresh-cut wood mixed with sawdust and something older, something that might be rot. Henrik van der Voort's coffin maker's shop occupies a two-story building on a quiet side street, its sign creaking in the wind: a painted coffin with wings.

The ground floor serves as workshop and showroom. Half-finished coffins line the walls in various stages of completion, from rough planks to polished caskets with ornate handles. Wood shavings carpet the floor. Tools hang from wall pegs: saws, planes, hammers, chisels. A workbench dominates the center of the room, scarred by years of use—and hiding a terrible secret in a false panel beneath.

Henrik himself appears perpetually nervous, jumping at sudden sounds, avoiding eye contact. His hands shake when he works. He becomes agitated if visitors express interest in going upstairs, inventing excuses: it's messy, it's locked, he lost the key. His terror is genuine. What he won't say: vampire spawn nest in his upstairs rooms, and St. Andral's bones lie hidden in his workbench—both "gifts" from a pale nobleman who paid handsomely and threatened worse than death.

## Return Description
You return to the coffin maker's shop, the smell of sawdust and fear unchanged. Henrik recognizes you, his nervousness intensifying. He knows you suspect something. His eyes dart to the workbench, then away. To the stairs, then away. Anywhere but meeting your gaze.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning finds Henrik already at work, the rhythmic sounds of saw and plane attempting normalcy. He accepts custom orders with trembling hands, quotes prices that seem too low—anything to get customers out quickly, before they ask questions. Before they notice the shuttered upstairs windows. Before they wonder about the scratching sounds from above. The shop door stays unlocked, but Henrik positions himself between visitors and both the workbench and the stairs.

### Night
After dark, the coffin maker's shop should close, but lights burn late in Henrik's workshop. He works through the night, unable to sleep knowing what lurks upstairs. The vampire spawn rest in their coffins during day, but at night they stir, testing the boundaries of their orders to remain hidden. Sometimes Henrik hears them moving on the floor above, and his hands shake so badly he must stop working. The bones in his workbench seem to pulse with faint holy energy, as if crying out to return to consecrated ground.
