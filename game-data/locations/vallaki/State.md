# Town of Vallaki - Current State

The Town of Vallaki continues its relentless cycle of enforced happiness. Baron Vargas Vallakovich has not yet staged his next festival—but preparations are already underway. Colorful banners hang from every building, fresh paint covers any surface that dared to fade, and town criers announce the coming celebration with desperate enthusiasm.

Father Lucian Petrovich tends to his church, unaware that the precious bones of St. Andral—the holy relics that have protected Vallaki from undead intrusion for generations—have been stolen. The theft was subtle, the thief careful. But without those bones, the church's sanctuary is a lie, and Vallaki stands vulnerable to the creatures of the night.

At the Blue Water Inn, Urwin Martikov serves travelers with his characteristic warmth, his true nature as a wereraven and member of the Keepers of the Feather known only to his family and closest allies. His latest guest, the flamboyant carnival master Rictavio, keeps to his room and his locked wagon, telling stories of distant lands and avoiding questions about his mysterious cargo.

Izek Strazni patrols the streets with cruel efficiency, his fiendish arm flexing as he dreams of a dark-haired woman he's never met. In his dreams, she calls to him. In his waking hours, he searches for her with obsessive determination, not knowing she is the sister he lost decades ago.

The townspeople smile. They celebrate. They fear. This is Vallaki: a town that believes painted cheerfulness can hold back the darkness, that mandatory festivals can break a centuries-old curse, that if they just try hard enough—smile wide enough—perhaps tomorrow will be better.

The darkness knows better. And it waits.
