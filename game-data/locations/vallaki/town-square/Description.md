# Town Square

## Overview
Vallaki's town square serves as the stage for the Baron's endless festivals—and the site of public punishment for those who fail to demonstrate sufficient enthusiasm. The stocks stand as a constant reminder that in Vallaki, happiness is mandatory.

## Initial Description
The town square opens before you, a broad cobblestone plaza that serves as Vallaki's heart—or more accurately, its stage. A raised wooden platform dominates one side, from which Baron Vallakovich delivers his manic proclamations. Festival decorations cover every available surface: ribbons, banners, painted props, and wooden effigies of suns.

The square's center holds the stocks—weathered wood darkened by years of use. Empty now, but you sense they fill often. Guards patrol the perimeter, watching the crowds for any sign of "malcontentedness." Shops and businesses ring the square, their facades painted in the Baron's approved cheerful colors.

The burgomaster's mansion looms over the eastern edge of the square, its excessive decorations making the Baron's presence felt constantly. To the northwest, the Church of St. Andral's bell tower rises above the rooftops, though its bells never ring anymore.

## Return Description
You enter the town square again, the familiar festival preparations ongoing. The decorations may have changed—new themes, new colors—but the underlying desperation remains constant. Guards eye you with recognition, noting your compliance with the Baron's cheerfulness requirements.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning in the town square brings market activity and festival preparations. Merchants set up stalls under watchful guard eyes. Workers erect new decorations under Izek's supervision. The Baron sometimes emerges to inspect preparations, his manic enthusiasm infectious in the worst way. Any prisoners in the stocks from yesterday's punishments are released—in time to participate in today's celebration, of course.

### Night
After curfew, the town square empties rapidly. The festival decorations cast strange shadows under moonlight and torchlight from the guard patrols. The stocks stand empty and ominous. Guards increase their presence, watching for curfew violators. Sometimes the Baron appears on his balcony, staring out at his domain, convincing himself that tomorrow's festival will be the one that finally works.
