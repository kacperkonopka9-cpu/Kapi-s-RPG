# Town of Vallaki

## Overview
The Town of Vallaki is a walled settlement of two thousand souls ruled by the tyrannical Baron Vargas Vallakovich. Every building wears fresh coats of garish paint, every eave bears festival decorations, and every citizen wears a forced smile—for in Vallaki, happiness is mandatory, and failure to demonstrate sufficient enthusiasm leads to the stocks or the Reformation Center. This is a town desperate to convince itself that festivals and painted smiles can keep Strahd's darkness at bay.

## Initial Description
The Town of Vallaki rises before you, a walled settlement of timber and false hope. Fifteen-foot-high palisade walls encircle the town, their rough-hewn logs darkened by age and weather. Guard towers flank the east and west gates, their watchfires casting dancing shadows across the walls even in daylight.

Beyond the walls, wooden buildings crowd together along a main road that runs east to west through the town's heart. Every structure bears a fresh coat of colorful paint—garish yellows, bright blues, cheerful reds—as if the very buildings themselves have been commanded to smile. Festive banners and ribbons hang from every eave, some fresh and vibrant, others faded and tattered from previous celebrations.

The air carries sounds of forced merriment: a town crier's overly enthusiastic announcements, the clatter of festival preparations, nervous laughter that cuts off too quickly. Guards patrol the streets in groups of three, their eyes scanning for any sign of "malcontentedness." Citizens hurry about their business with painted smiles and anxious eyes, careful to appear appropriately cheerful.

The town's silhouette reveals key structures: the stone church with its bell tower rising above the wooden rooftops to the northwest, the burgomaster's two-story mansion dominating the town square, and the Blue Water Inn's distinctive blue-painted facade near the east gate. Smoke rises from countless chimneys, and the scent of cooking food mingles uncomfortably with something else—the faint, sour smell of fear beneath the veneer of celebration.

This is Vallaki: a town that has convinced itself that happiness can be enforced, that festivals can keep the darkness at bay, and that painted smiles are as good as real ones.

## Return Description
You approach Vallaki once more, the walled town a familiar sight against the dreary Barovian landscape. The guards at the gates recognize you now, their scrutiny slightly less intense but no less vigilant. The festival decorations may have changed—new themes, new colors—but the underlying atmosphere remains unchanged: forced cheer masking genuine terror. The town's daily rhythm has become familiar, and you know which streets to take and which citizens dare speak honestly.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning in Vallaki brings fresh festival preparations and renewed forced cheerfulness. The gates open at dawn to admit travelers, farmers from outlying homesteads, and Vistani traders. The Baron's town criers make their rounds, announcing the next festival with manic enthusiasm. Shopkeepers open their brightly-painted doors, guards change shifts at the watch posts, and the smell of fresh bread from the bakeries almost—almost—makes Vallaki feel like a normal town. But the stocks in the town square already hold yesterday's "malcontents," and the nervous energy never quite fades.

### Night
After sunset, Vallaki transforms. The colorful paint fades to gray under pale moonlight. The festival decorations cast strange shadows that twist in the wind. The streets empty quickly after curfew. Shutters close. Doors bar. The town that demands happiness by day huddles in fear by night, knowing that walls and festivals mean nothing to the creatures that hunt in Barovia's darkness.

The gates seal with heavy wooden bars. Guard patrols become more frequent, more nervous, their torches insufficient against the darkness pressing in from beyond the walls. Occasionally, screams pierce the night—sometimes from within the Reformation Center, sometimes from beyond the walls, sometimes from nowhere identifiable at all.

The church bell tower stands dark and silent, Father Lucian having long since given up ringing the evening bells. The Blue Water Inn's windows glow with warm light, one of the few places that dares maintain a semblance of normalcy after dark. The burgomaster's mansion remains lit throughout the night, the Baron's paranoia ensuring every lamp burns until dawn.
