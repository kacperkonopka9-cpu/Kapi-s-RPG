# Burgomaster Mansion

## Overview
Baron Vargas Vallakovich's ostentatious two-story residence dominates Vallaki's town square. Every surface gleams with garish paint and gilding, a monument to the Baron's delusional belief that enforced happiness can defeat Strahd's curse.

## Initial Description
The burgomaster's mansion stands in stark contrast to Vallaki's worn buildings—a two-story structure painted in aggressive yellows and blues, its trim covered in gold leaf that catches the light. Festival banners drape every window. Carved wooden suns adorn the eaves. Even the door handles are shaped like smiling faces.

Inside, the obsession continues. Every room overflows with festival decorations, trophy proclamations of past "triumphs," and portraits of the Baron looking manically cheerful. Guards in ceremonial (but functional) armor stand at attention. Servants hurry through halls, their smiles painted as garishly as the walls.

The Baron's study occupies the mansion's finest room, overlooking the town square where his festivals unfold. Izek Strazni's quarters adjoin the main building—close enough to respond to the Baron's summons instantly. And in the attic, Victor Vallakovich experiments with magic his father knows nothing about.

## Return Description
You approach the burgomaster's mansion once more, its excessive decorations familiar now. The guards recognize you but remain vigilant—in the Baron's house, no smile is quite genuine enough, no enthusiasm quite sufficient.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning brings frantic activity to the mansion as the Baron plans his next festival. Servants carry armloads of decorations, carpenters construct props, and the Baron's voice echoes through the halls issuing contradictory orders with manic energy. Izek stalks the grounds, his demonic arm hidden beneath his cloak, ensuring the Baron's will is executed without question.

### Night
At night, the mansion blazes with light from every window—the Baron's paranoia ensures darkness never claims his residence. Guards patrol with lanterns. The Baron himself rarely sleeps, instead planning festivals, reviewing "malcontent" lists, and convincing himself that tomorrow's celebration will finally break the curse. From the attic, strange lights occasionally flicker—Victor practicing his teleportation magic in secret.
