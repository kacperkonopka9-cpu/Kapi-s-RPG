# Burgomaster Mansion - Current State

Baron Vallakovich's mansion serves as festival headquarters, the Baron obsessively planning his next celebration to "break the curse." Izek patrols from here, his dreams of a dark-haired woman consuming his thoughts. Victor experiments with dangerous magic in the attic, desperate to escape.
