# Church of St. Andral

## Overview
Vallaki's oldest and most solid structure—a weathered stone building with a modest bell tower. For centuries, St. Andral's bones protected this church from undead intrusion, but those sacred relics have been stolen, leaving the sanctuary defenseless.

## Initial Description
The Church of St. Andral stands as Vallaki's oldest and most solid structure—a weathered stone building with a modest bell tower rising above the wooden town. Unlike the garish colors demanded by the Baron, the church maintains its dignified gray stone, a quiet act of resistance.

Inside, simple wooden pews face an altar bearing the symbol of the Morninglord. Candlelight flickers across worn prayer books and faded tapestries depicting saints and miracles from ages past. The air smells of old incense and damp stone. Father Lucian Petrovich tends to his flock here, offering what comfort he can in this cursed land.

A narrow staircase behind the altar leads down to the crypt where St. Andral's bones should rest—the blessed relics that have protected Vallaki from undead intrusion for centuries. But the crypt's stone door stands slightly ajar, and Father Lucian's eyes carry a weight of terrible knowledge he dare not voice.

## Return Description
You return to the Church of St. Andral, its stone walls a familiar sanctuary in Vallaki's madness. Father Lucian greets you with weary hope, his prayers continuing despite mounting dread.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning light streams through the church's narrow windows, casting colored patterns across the stone floor from the stained glass. Father Lucian conducts morning prayers for a small congregation of elderly townspeople who dare defy the Baron's festivals to maintain their faith. The bell tower stands silent—the Baron forbade its ringing years ago, claiming it disturbed festival preparations.

### Night
At night, the church becomes one of the few buildings in Vallaki where lights burn late. Father Lucian keeps vigil, candles lit before the altar, praying for protection that may no longer exist. The shadows seem deeper here now, pressing against the walls as if testing for weakness. Without St. Andral's bones, the church's ancient sanctity wanes with each sunset.
