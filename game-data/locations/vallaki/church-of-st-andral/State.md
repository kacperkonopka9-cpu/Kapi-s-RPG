# Church of St. Andral - Current State

The Church of St. Andral stands as it has for centuries, a beacon of faith in Barovia's darkness. Father Lucian tends to his duties, unaware that the sacred bones protecting his church—and all of Vallaki—have been stolen. The crypt beneath the altar stands empty, its sanctity violated. Time runs short before the consequences of this theft become horrifyingly clear.
