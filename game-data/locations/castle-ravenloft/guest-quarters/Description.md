# Castle Ravenloft - Guest Quarters

## Overview
The guest quarters house Strahd's vampire spawn consorts (brides): Ludmilla, Anastrasya, and Volenta, plus Escher. These lavish but decaying rooms include lounges, bedchambers, and the famous portrait of Tatyana. Combat here means facing multiple vampire spawn in close quarters.

## Initial Description
You enter a series of interconnected chambers that were once luxurious guest suites. Red velvet curtains, four-poster beds with silk sheets, ornate furniture—all covered in dust and decay. The air smells of perfume and blood.

In one room (K56) hangs a portrait of extraordinary beauty: a young woman with auburn hair and haunting eyes. This is Tatyana, Strahd's eternal obsession. Her painted gaze follows you, melancholic and knowing.

## Return Description
The guest quarters remain as you left them—luxurious decay, the scent of perfume and blood, Tatyana's portrait watching silently. The vampire spawn may be present or hunting elsewhere in the castle.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Vampire spawn rest here during the day (in coffins or dark corners). Vulnerable but defended. Attacking during day provokes desperate defense.

### Night
At night, vampire spawn are active—lounging, reading, or hunting. 70% chance 2d3 spawn present. Combat likely.

## Rooms and Areas

### K49: Lounge
Central gathering room. Comfortable chairs, small library, wine (blood) service. Vampire spawn socialize here.

### K50-K51: Guest Rooms
Individual bedchambers for vampire spawn. Personal effects, coffins (not true resting places, just daytime shelters), treasures.

### K56: Portrait of Tatyana
Most significant room. Portrait hangs above fireplace. Strahd visits here to gaze at it. DC 15 Investigation reveals hidden passage behind portrait.

### K54-K57: Tower Access
Stairs and passages to rooftops and tower peaks. High winds, gargoyle encounters possible.

## Points of Interest
- **Tatyana's Portrait (K56)** - Hauntingly beautiful, hides secret passage
- **Vampire Spawn Coffins** - Daytime shelters (not true resting places)
- **Personal Treasures** - Each spawn has collection of jewelry, art
- **Tower Access** - Stairs to rooftops and overlooks

## Atmosphere
Guest quarters embody twisted domesticity—vampire spawn maintaining pretense of civilized living while their true nature (predators) remains barely concealed beneath veneer of culture.
