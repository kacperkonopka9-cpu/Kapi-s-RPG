# Castle Ravenloft - Overlook - Current State

The overlooks stand exposed to elements, high winds howling across parapets and tower peaks. Gargoyles perch motionless—some decorative, some alive and waiting. The view of Barovia valley stretches below, revealing the full extent of the cursed domain: mist-shrouded walls in all directions, no escape.

At night, Strahd sometimes stands here, surveying his kingdom with melancholic detachment. By day, the overlooks are empty save for the ever-present gargoyles. The winds never cease, the drop remains fatal, and the view reminds all who see it that this domain is a prison from which there is no exit—not for Strahd, and not for those trapped with him.
