# Castle Ravenloft - Overlook

## Overview
The Overlook encompasses the castle's high towers, balconies, and rooftops with commanding views of Barovia valley. High winds, gargoyle encounters, and vertiginous heights make this area dangerous. Strahd retreats here if wounded, using height advantage.

## Initial Description
You ascend to the castle's highest points—a series of interconnected towers and balconies hundreds of feet above the ground. The view is simultaneously breathtaking and oppressive: the entire Barovia valley spreads below, shrouded in mist. The Svalich Wood stretches to the horizon. The Village of Barovia looks like a toy settlement far below.

High winds buffet you constantly (DC 12 Strength save or pushed back 5 feet). Arrow-slit windows provide firing positions. Gargoyles perch on parapets—some decorative, some living guardians. The drop to the ground is 500+ feet. One misstep means death.

## Return Description
You return to the overlooks. The winds still howl, the view still inspires dread, the gargoyles still watch. This is where Strahd demonstrates his dominion over the valley—he can see everything from here, and his enemies can fall a very long way.

## Time-Based Variants
### Morning/Day
View is clearest during day. Full extent of Barovia visible (revealing how small and trapped the domain is). Gargoyles clearly visible, easy to distinguish living from stone.

### Night
At night, valley below is darkness punctuated by few lights (village, Tser Pool camp). Gargoyles indistinguishable from shadows. Wind sounds like screaming. Strahd may be here, surveying his domain (40% chance).

## Rooms and Areas

## Atmosphere
The overlooks embody Strahd's perspective—he looks down on his domain from great height, master of all he surveys, yet trapped as surely as those below. The view reveals the prison's extent: mist-shrouded walls in all directions, no escape.
