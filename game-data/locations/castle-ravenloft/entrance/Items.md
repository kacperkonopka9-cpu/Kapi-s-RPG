# Items in Castle Ravenloft - Entrance

## Overview
The entrance area contains minimal treasure, as it serves primarily as a defensive chokepoint rather than a storage area. Most items here are functional (weapons, armor) or hidden in obscure locations. Strahd does not leave valuable treasures in areas easily accessible to intruders.

## Visible Items

### Torches (Wall Sconces)
- **Item ID:** entrance_torches
- **Name:** Everburning Torches
- **Category:** Light Source
- **Location:** Mounted in wall sconces throughout courtyard (K1) and gate passage (K2)
- **Description:** These torches burn with a cold, flickering light that seems to be absorbed by the darkness rather than dispelling it. They never go out, sustained by minor necromantic magic.
- **Properties:** Provide dim light in 20-foot radius (not bright light). Cannot be extinguished by normal means.
- **Value:** 10 gp each if removed (8 torches total)
- **Curse:** If removed from the castle, the torches burn out within 1 hour. They are bound to Castle Ravenloft's necrotic energy.

### Strahd's Carriage (K4)
- **Item ID:** strahd_carriage
- **Name:** Count Strahd's Personal Coach
- **Category:** Vehicle

- **Properties:** Magically reinforced (AC 19, 100 HP). Interior is extradimensional (larger inside than outside, seats 8 comfortably).
- **Value:** Priceless (10,000 gp if it could be sold, which it cannot)
- **Warning:** DO NOT TOUCH. Nightmare steeds attack anyone who touches the carriage without Strahd's permission (see NPCs.md).
- **Secret:** DC 18 Investigation check of interior reveals hidden compartment beneath seat containing Strahd's travel gear (see Hidden Items).

## Integration Notes
All items use Epic 3 Item Database schema. When items are discovered or collected:
1. Update State.md `discovered_items` array
2. Trigger relevant events (e.g., opening travel compartment triggers poison trap)
3. If Strahd's carriage is looted, Strahd becomes aware immediately via Sending Stone (if stone is taken, he knows party has it)

**DM Note:** Entrance loot is deliberately modest. This is the first area—players should not be showered with treasure yet. The real treasures lie deeper in the castle (treasury, catacombs, tower).
