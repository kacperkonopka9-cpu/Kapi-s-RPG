# Castle Ravenloft - Entrance

## Overview
The entrance to Castle Ravenloft represents the first line of defense for the vampire lord's domain. This area encompasses the treacherous approach across a narrow stone bridge, the courtyard beyond the main gates, and the outer structures including the chapel garden and carriage house. Gargoyles watch from above, animated armor stands ready in alcoves, and an oppressive sense of dread permeates the cold stone walls.

## Initial Description
You stand before the massive iron-banded gates of Castle Ravenloft. The narrow stone bridge you just crossed spans a chasm so deep that its bottom disappears into swirling mist—one false step would mean a fall into oblivion. The bridge terminates at twin guard towers flanking the gates, their arrow slits like dead eyes watching your approach.

The gates themselves are works of dark artistry: twelve feet tall, reinforced with black iron bands, and engraved with the von Zarovich coat of arms—a raven clutching a broken sword. Above the gates, stone gargoyles leer down, and you cannot tell which are mere sculptures and which might suddenly spring to life.

Beyond the gates, you glimpse a courtyard shrouded in shadow. Torches flicker in wall sconces, their light seeming to be absorbed by the darkness rather than dispelling it. The walls rise fifty feet on all sides, with narrow windows and archer posts overlooking the killing ground below.

To the right of the courtyard, a side passage leads to what appears to be a carriage house. To the left, you see a small chapel garden overgrown with thorny vines and dead flowers. Directly ahead, across the courtyard, a heavy wooden door stands closed—the entrance to the castle's grand entry hall.

The temperature drops noticeably as you pass through the gates. The air is thick with the scent of old stone, decay, and something you can't quite identify—perhaps fear itself, accumulated over centuries.

## Return Description
You return to the entrance of Castle Ravenloft. The iron-banded gates loom before you, the bridge spans the chasm behind, and the courtyard stretches ahead into shadow. You know now what awaits beyond these walls—the undead guardians, the oppressive malevolence, the sense of being watched by something patient and infinitely dangerous.

The gargoyles still watch from their perches. The gates stand open or closed as you left them. The torches continue their feeble struggle against the darkness. And somewhere within, Count Strahd von Zarovich waits, ever aware of who enters and leaves his domain.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Dawn brings no comfort to Castle Ravenloft's entrance. The pale morning light struggles to penetrate the perpetual mist rising from the chasm, and what little illumination reaches the courtyard seems drained of warmth and life. The gargoyles are clearly visible now—and you can see that several have shifted position since you last looked, their stone eyes tracking your movements with slow, deliberate malice.

### Day
Wan daylight filters into the courtyard, but the shadows remain unnaturally deep. The walls seem to absorb light rather than reflect it, creating pools of darkness even at noon. You can see the full extent of the entrance area now: the chapel garden to the left is completely dead, not a single living plant among the thorns; the carriage house to the right has its doors hanging open, revealing only darkness within; and the courtyard cobblestones are stained with old, dark patches that might be ancient bloodstains.

### Night
True night transforms the entrance into a realm of nightmare. The torches cast flickering shadows that seem to move with malevolent purpose. The gargoyles are now indistinguishable from the darkness, and you cannot tell which direction they face—or if they have moved closer. The chasm behind you breathes cold mist that rolls across the bridge and pools in the courtyard, swirling around your ankles like grasping fingers. This is Strahd's domain at its most powerful, and the entrance itself seems to whisper warnings to turn back while you still can.

## Rooms and Areas

### K1: Front Courtyard
A large open space (50 feet × 60 feet) paved with ancient cobblestones. The courtyard is overlooked by walls on all sides, with archer posts and windows at regular intervals. In the center stands a dry fountain—its basin cracked, its statue of a raven defaced and missing a wing. The courtyard is a deliberate killing ground: no cover, multiple elevated positions for defenders, only one exit besides the main gates.

**Hidden Feature:** DC 15 Perception check reveals murder holes in the ceiling of the gate passage—defenders above can pour boiling oil or shoot through these openings.

### K2: Center Court Gate
The passage through the outer wall, beneath the guard towers. Twenty feet long, fifteen feet wide, with a vaulted stone ceiling twenty feet high. The massive iron gates can be lowered to seal this passage completely (DC 25 Strength check to lift). Murder holes dot the ceiling. Arrow slits pierce the walls.

**Trap:** If intruders are detected, animated armor in the guard towers can attack through the murder holes or sally forth to engage in melee.

### K3: Servants' Entrance
A narrow side door (five feet wide) set into the right wall of the courtyard. This door leads to a cramped corridor connecting the carriage house, kitchen stores, and servants' quarters. The door is locked (DC 15 to pick) and reinforced with iron bands.

**Secret:** This is how servants and minions move between the entrance and interior without being seen. Vampire spawn use this route frequently.

### K4: Carriage House
A large outbuilding (30 feet × 40 feet) with double doors facing the courtyard. Inside, you find three ancient carriages in various states of decay. One is a black coach with red velvet interior—Strahd's personal carriage, drawn by black horses with glowing red eyes (nightmare steeds). The coach is in perfect condition despite the surrounding decay.

**Encounter:** If anyone touches Strahd's carriage without permission, the nightmare steeds animate and attack (2 Nightmares, CR 3 each).

### K5: Chapel Garden
A small walled garden (20 feet × 30 feet) adjacent to the courtyard. Every plant here is dead or dying: black roses with thorns like needles, twisted brambles, a dead oak tree with hanging vines. A stone bench sits beneath the tree, and a small shrine to the Morninglord stands defaced and broken.

**Item:** DC 13 Investigation check reveals a silver holy symbol buried beneath the brambles at the shrine's base (worth 25 gp, can be used as a +1 bonus to turning undead in the castle).

### K6: Overlook
A stone platform accessible via exterior stairs from the courtyard, overlooking the chasm and the approach to the castle. The overlook is a semicircular balcony (15 feet deep) with a low stone railing. From here, defenders can rain arrows or spells down on anyone crossing the bridge.

**Hazard:** Strong winds buffet the overlook (DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet). In combat, characters could be forced over the edge into the chasm (1,000-foot fall).

### K7: Entry Door
A heavy wooden door (8 feet tall, 6 feet wide) bound with iron and engraved with screaming faces. This door leads from the courtyard into the castle's grand entry hall. The door is never locked—Strahd welcomes visitors to enter, confident in his ability to deal with any threat.

**Atmosphere:** As you approach this door, you hear faint organ music from within, growing louder as you reach for the handle. The screaming faces on the door seem to track your movements, their mouths opening wider in silent warnings.

## Atmosphere
The entrance to Castle Ravenloft is designed to intimidate and crush hope. Every architectural detail reinforces the message: you are entering the domain of something ancient, powerful, and infinitely patient. The gargoyles watch. The shadows move. The cold seeps into your bones. And beyond the courtyard door, the faint sound of organ music promises that the master of the castle knows you have arrived—and welcomes your visit.

This is the threshold between the world of the living and the realm of the undead. Cross it at your peril.
