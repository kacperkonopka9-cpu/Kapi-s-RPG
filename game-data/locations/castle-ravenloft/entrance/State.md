# Castle Ravenloft - Entrance - Current State

The entrance to Castle Ravenloft stands silent and menacing. The massive iron-banded gates are closed but not locked, the drawbridge spans the chasm, and the courtyard beyond waits in shadow. Torches flicker in wall sconces, casting feeble light that seems to be absorbed by the oppressive darkness.

Four gargoyles perch on the walls and towers, motionless as stone—indistinguishable from mere decorations. In the carriage house to the right, Strahd's personal coach rests in immaculate condition, harnessed to two nightmare steeds that stand perfectly still, their eyes dark and lifeless. In the chapel garden to the left, dead vines and thorny brambles choke the ruins of a defaced shrine.

The courtyard cobblestones are ancient and stained with dark patches that might be centuries-old bloodstains. A dry fountain sits in the center, its raven statue defaced and missing a wing. The walls rise fifty feet on all sides, with narrow windows and archer posts overlooking the killing ground below.

At the far end of the courtyard, a heavy wooden door stands closed. The door is carved with screaming faces, their mouths open in silent warnings. From beyond that door, faint and distant, comes the sound of organ music—beautiful, haunting, and profoundly unsettling.

This is the threshold. Beyond this point, there is no turning back. The castle waits. The master waits. And those who enter do so at their peril.

No one has yet disturbed this ancient stronghold. But that is about to change.
