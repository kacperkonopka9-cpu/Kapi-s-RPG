## Count Strahd von Zarovich (Special Encounter)
- **Type:** Vampire (Legendary Creature)
- **CR:** 15
- **Status:** May appear in entrance if he wishes to greet "guests" personally
- **Location:** Typically appears in courtyard (K1) or at entry door (K7)
- **Behavior:** Charming, welcoming, but with underlying menace and mockery
- **Dialogue:** See parent castle-ravenloft/NPCs.md for full profile

### Entrance-Specific Dialogue
- **Greeting:** "Welcome to Castle Ravenloft. I have been expecting you. Please, do come in—I so rarely have visitors worthy of my attention."
- **Invitation:** "You have traveled far to reach my home. It would be rude of me not to offer you hospitality. Dinner will be served in the dining hall. I trust you will join me?"
- **Mockery:** "Such brave souls, to march across my bridge and pound upon my gates. Tell me, do you believe yourselves heroes? Or do you merely lack the wisdom to recognize when you are outmatched?"
- **Warning:** "I could end you here and now, but where would be the sport in that? No, I shall allow you to wander my halls, to struggle and hope and believe you have a chance. It will make your eventual despair all the sweeter."

### AI Behavior Notes for Entrance Encounter
- **Phase 1 (Observation):** Strahd appears alone, unarmed, and seemingly cordial. He assesses party strength, magical items, tactics.
- **Testing:** May use Charm on strongest-willed character to gauge resistances. If successful, commands them to attack their allies briefly, then releases them ("A test. You failed.").
- **Psychological Warfare:** Comments on party's equipment, tactics, past failures. References things he shouldn't know (scrying on party).
- **No Combat:** Strahd does NOT initiate combat in entrance (too early, not dramatic enough). If attacked, he laughs, turns to mist, and vanishes through the walls. "So impatient. We shall meet again—on MY terms."
- **Invitation:** Leaves party with ominous invitation to explore castle, promising "entertainment" ahead.

## Encounter Notes
**Normal State:** Entrance is defended by gargoyles and animated armor (CR 2-3 encounters for level 8 party).

**Alarmed State:** If combat lasts more than 3 rounds or gargoyles destroyed, vampire spawn reinforcements arrive (1d3 vampire spawn, CR 5 each).

**Strahd's Presence:** If Strahd appears, he dominates the scene. He will NOT fight to the death here—this is Act 1 of his psychological game. He wants the party to enter the castle, to hope, to struggle, and ultimately to despair.

**Consequences:** Any combat in entrance alerts entire castle. Strahd knows party is here. Lair actions activate. Escape becomes significantly harder.
