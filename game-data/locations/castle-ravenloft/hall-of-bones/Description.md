# Castle Ravenloft - Hall of Bones

## Overview
The Hall of Bones serves as a macabre entrance to the lower crypts, featuring a giant's skull gateway. Skeletal guardians and strategic chokepoint. Connects upper castle to catacombs.

## Initial Description
A vast hall (60 feet long, 40 feet wide) with walls lined with bones arranged in geometric patterns. At the far end, a massive giant's skull (20 feet tall) serves as a gateway—its open mouth forms a passage descending to the crypts below. Skeletal guardians stand in alcoves, awaiting intruders.

## Return Description
The Hall of Bones remains as foreboding as before. The giant's skull gateway still leads downward to the catacombs, and the skeletal guardians wait to activate.

## Time-Based Variants
### Morning/Day
Bone decorations clearly visible. Guardian positions obvious. Strategic planning possible.

### Night
Shadows obscure guardian locations. Ambush risk higher. Undead more active.
