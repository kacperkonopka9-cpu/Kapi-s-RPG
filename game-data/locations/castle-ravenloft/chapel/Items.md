# Items in Castle Ravenloft - Chapel

## Overview
The chapel contains few material treasures, as most valuable items were removed or destroyed during its desecration. However, it holds items of profound historical and spiritual significance—relics of Strahd's fall and potential artifacts of redemption.

## Visible Items

### Tarnished Silver Candle Holders (K15)
- **Item ID:** chapel_candle_holders
- **Name:** Von Zarovich Chapel Candle Holders
- **Category:** Art Objects
- **Location:** On and around altar (K15)
- **Description:** Six tall silver candle holders, once polished and gleaming, now tarnished black. They hold burned candles with wax pooled like congealed blood.
- **Properties:** Functional candle holders, silver material
- **Value:** 15 gp each (90 gp total for all 6)
- **Curse:** If removed from chapel, holder becomes ice-cold to touch (1d4 cold damage per round of contact). Returns to normal if brought back.

### Broken Holy Symbols (K15)
- **Item ID:** broken_holy_symbols
- **Name:** Fragments of Morninglord Symbols
- **Category:** Religious Items (Desecrated)
- **Location:** Scattered on floor around altar (K15)
- **Description:** Silver and gold fragments of holy symbols—sunbursts, dawn imagery, rays of light—all deliberately smashed and defiled.
- **Properties:** Non-functional (too damaged to serve as holy symbols)
- **Value:** 2d10 gp in precious metal scrap
- **Restoration:** If a cleric or paladin spends 8 hours and 100 gp in materials, can repair ONE holy symbol. Restored symbol functions as +1 holy symbol (bonus to Turn Undead) but only within Barovia (blessing fades if taken outside the domain).

### Tattered Altar Cloth (K15)
- **Item ID:** torn_altar_cloth
- **Name:** Blood-Stained Altar Cloth
- **Category:** Cloth/Evidence
- **Location:** Torn remnants around altar (K15)
- **Description:** Once fine white silk embroidered with holy symbols, now torn, stained with old blood, and crumpled. The blood is Sergei's, spilled three centuries ago.
- **Properties:** Historical artifact, evidence of Strahd's crime
- **Value:** Worthless monetarily, priceless historically
- **Lore:** If examined with Detect Magic, reveals lingering traces of powerful curse magic (the moment Strahd's transformation was sealed).

## Hidden Items

### Sergei's Dagger (Beneath Altar)
- **Item ID:** sergeis_dagger
- **Name:** The Murder Weapon
- **Category:** Weapon (Dagger) / Cursed Item
- **Location:** Hidden compartment beneath altar (K15), DC 16 Investigation to find
- **Description:** An ornate dagger with jeweled handle and silver blade. This is the weapon Strahd used to murder his brother Sergei at the altar. The blade is still stained with dried blood that will not wash off.
- **Properties:**
  - **Weapon:** +1 dagger, 1d4+1 piercing damage
  - **Effective vs Strahd:** If used against Strahd, deals an additional 1d6 psychic damage (his guilt manifests as pain)
  - **Cursed:** Wielder must make DC 13 Wisdom save each day or become obsessed with thoughts of betrayal and murder (disadvantage on Insight checks regarding allies' loyalty)
- **Value:** 250 gp (jeweled handle) + historical significance
- **Quest Relevance:** Can be used to confront Strahd about his crime, or returned to Sergei's tomb in catacombs (may grant blessing or quest advancement)

### Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (Possible Legendary Artifact)
- **Item ID:** holy_symbol_of_ravenkind
- **Name:** Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (Legendary Artifact)
- **Category:** Artifact / Holy Relic
- **Location:** IF Tarokka reading places it here—hidden in altar compartment with dagger, OR manifests after spectral guardian's test
- **Description:** A platinum amulet shaped as a sun with a large crystal embedded in its center. The crystal is the size of a child's fist and glows with inner light. This is one of three legendary artifacts needed to defeat Strahd permanently.
- **Properties:**
  - **Holy Light:** As an action, holder can make the crystal emit bright sunlight in 30-foot radius, dim light for additional 30 feet (lasts 10 minutes, recharges at dawn)
  - **Protection:** Holder has advantage on saving throws vs undead and fiends
  - **Turn Undead Boost:** Cleric/paladin wielding this symbol increases Turn Undead range by 30 feet and DC by +2
  - **Harm Strahd:** When Strahd is in sunlight from this symbol, he takes 20 radiant damage per round (no save)
  - **Attunement:** Requires attunement by good-aligned cleric or paladin
- **Value:** Priceless (legendary artifact)
- **Quest Impact:** Finding this artifact is major milestone. Strahd becomes aware immediately and shifts to more aggressive tactics.

### Secret Passage Key (K17)

- **Name:** False Niche Back Panel
- **Category:** Mechanism
- **Location:** South corridor (K17), hidden behind statue niche, DC 15 Investigation
- **Description:** A false back panel in one of the "empty" statue niches. Pushing it reveals a narrow stairway descending into darkness—a secret route to the catacombs.
- **Properties:** Allows bypassing normal catacombs approach, provides tactical advantage
- **Trap:** First three steps are trapped (DC 14 Perception to notice, DC 13 Dexterity save or trigger pressure plate causing ceiling spikes—2d10 piercing damage)

## Quest Items

### Tome of Strahd (Alternate Location)
If Tarokka reading places Tome here instead of Great Entry Hall or Treasury:
- **Location:** Hidden beneath Queen Ravenovia's tomb (K15), accessible only if tomb moved (Strength DC 18 to slide tomb aside)
- **Description:** Black leather tome with iron clasps, Strahd's autobiography
- **Properties:** See great-entry/Items.md for full Tome of Strahd properties
- **Note:** Moving tomb triggers wraith guardians (see NPCs.md)

### Consecration Materials (Optional Quest Item)
- **Item ID:** consecration_components
- **Name:** Materials for Reconsecrating Chapel
- **Category:** Quest Components
- **Location:** Must be gathered from multiple locations
- **Description:** If party wishes to attempt reconsecrating the chapel (remove divine magic suppression), they need:
  1. Holy water (10 vials) - from blessed source outside Barovia
  2. Silver dust (1 lb) - from broken holy symbols or purchased
  3. Morninglord prayers (complete text) - from Village of Barovia church
  4. Cleric or paladin of at least 9th level
- **Ritual:** Takes 8 hours, DC 18 Religion check
- **Success:** Divine magic suppression lifted, undead have disadvantage in chapel, party gains blessing (advantage on one save vs Strahd)
- **Failure:** Strahd appears immediately and attacks (took it as personal insult)
- **Strahd's Response:** If consecration succeeds, Strahd is enraged. Chapel becomes his priority target—he will attempt to desecrate it again.

## Integration Notes
All items use Epic 3 Item Database schema. When items are discovered or collected:
1. Update State.md `discovered_items` array
2. Trigger relevant events (wraith guardians if tombs disturbed, Strahd awareness if Holy Symbol taken)
3. If Holy Symbol of Ravenkind found, trigger major quest update
4. If consecration attempted, trigger special event (see Events.md)

**DM Note:** Chapel treasures are primarily historical/spiritual rather than monetary. The real value here is in artifacts (Holy Symbol), quest items (dagger, Tome), and lore. Monetary treasure is deliberately limited to reinforce that this location's significance is spiritual/narrative rather than material.
