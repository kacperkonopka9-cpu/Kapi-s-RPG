# Castle Ravenloft - Chapel

## Overview
The Chapel of Castle Ravenloft was once a place of worship and reverence, where the von Zarovich family received blessings and conducted holy rites. Now it stands desecrated and profane, its altar defiled, its holy symbols broken, and its sanctity utterly corrupted. This is where Strahd's parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia von Zarovich, lie entombed—and where Strahd's own transformation into a vampire was sealed when he murdered his brother Sergei at the altar on what should have been Sergei's wedding day.

## Initial Description
You enter a once-grand chapel that has been systematically desecrated. The chamber is forty feet long and thirty feet wide, with a vaulted ceiling twenty-five feet high. Stained glass windows along the walls depict religious scenes, but many panes are cracked or missing, and those that remain show images twisted into mockeries of their original meaning—saints with hollow eyes, angels with broken wings, the Morninglord eclipsed by darkness.

At the far end of the chapel stands an altar of black marble, its surface stained with old blood that no amount of cleaning could ever remove. The altar cloth has been torn away, and the holy symbols that once adorned it lie broken and scattered on the floor. Burned candles stand in tarnished silver holders, their wax pooled like congealed blood.

The pews are smashed and overturned, their wood splintered as if by great violence. Dust and debris cover everything. The air is thick with the stench of decay and corruption, and an oppressive spiritual weight presses down on you—as if the very stones remember the atrocities committed here and weep for what was lost.

On either side of the altar, stone tombs rise from the floor. Engraved plaques identify them as the final resting places of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia von Zarovich, Strahd's parents. The tombs are intact but show signs of violence—claw marks on the stone, as if something tried to escape... or something tried to break in.

The chapel feels actively hostile to life and goodness. Divine magic seems weaker here, as if the very air resists holy power. This is cursed ground, stained by patricide, fratricide, and the birth of a monster.

## Return Description
You return to the desecrated chapel. The broken pews, the bloodstained altar, the defaced stained glass, and the tombs of Strahd's parents remain as you left them. The oppressive spiritual weight still presses down, making it difficult to breathe, difficult to hope. You know this chapel has not seen a genuine prayer in three centuries, and perhaps it never will again.

This place is a monument to Strahd's fall from grace, a physical manifestation of the moment when he chose eternal damnation over noble death. Every detail speaks of corruption, and the shadows here seem darker than elsewhere in the castle.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning light filters through the broken stained glass, creating patterns of colored light on the dusty floor. But even in daylight, the chapel feels wrong. The light seems tainted as it passes through the desecrated windows, and the shadows in the corners resist being driven back. You can see the full extent of the damage now: every holy symbol has been deliberately defaced, every representation of divine goodness systematically destroyed. This was not mere neglect—this was methodical desecration.

### Day
Pale afternoon light illuminates the chapel but brings no warmth. You can see the details of the stained glass windows clearly now, and you realize with horror that some have been deliberately altered—new panels inserted showing darker themes. One depicts a wedding that ends in murder. Another shows a beautiful woman falling to her death. A third shows a count kneeling before a dark figure, receiving a crimson gift. These are Strahd's own additions, chronicling his damnation in glass and lead.

### Night
In darkness, the chapel becomes a focal point of spiritual corruption. Shadows pool in unnatural ways, seeming to move toward the altar as if drawn by some unholy magnetism. The tombs of Strahd's parents seem to radiate cold, and occasionally you hear sounds from within—scratching, whispering, weeping. Whether these are the actual spirits of the dead or merely echoes of past atrocities is impossible to tell. Divine magic is at its weakest here at night (see Special Properties).

## Rooms and Areas

### K15: Chapel (Main Chamber)
The primary chapel chamber described above. Forty feet long, thirty feet wide, twenty-five-foot vaulted ceiling. Contains altar, broken pews, stained glass windows, and the tombs of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia.

**Divine Magic Suppression:** All divine spells cast in this chapel require a DC 15 spellcasting ability check. On failure, the spell fails and the slot is expended. At night, DC increases to 17.

**Hidden Feature:** DC 16 Investigation of the altar reveals a hidden compartment beneath the bloodstains. Contains a dagger with ornate handle (the dagger Strahd used to kill Sergei—see Items.md).

**Unholy Aura:** Undead in this chapel have advantage on saving throws against Turn Undead. Good-aligned celestials cannot enter without making DC 17 Charisma save each round or be repelled.

### K16: North Chapel Access
A short corridor (ten feet wide, fifteen feet long) leading from the chapel to the northern areas of the castle. The walls are lined with niches that once held religious statues, now empty or containing headless, defaced remnants. A heavy wooden door at the far end is warped and scratched, as if by claws.

**Encounter Point:** If chapel is on alert, vampire spawn may emerge from this corridor (see Events.md).

### K17: South Chapel Access
A matching corridor (ten feet wide, fifteen feet long) leading south. Similar to K16, with empty or defaced statue niches. This passage connects to the great entry hall and other main-level chambers.

**Secret:** DC 15 Investigation reveals one "empty" niche actually conceals a hidden passage behind a false back. The passage leads down to the catacombs (allows bypassing normal route).

## Atmosphere
The chapel is perhaps the most spiritually oppressive location in Castle Ravenloft. Where other areas merely feel cold and hostile, the chapel feels actively malevolent toward goodness and faith. Clerics and paladins feel the weight of desecration most keenly—their prayers feel muffled, their divine connection strained, as if their gods struggle to reach them through the corruption that saturates this place.

This is where Strahd committed his defining sin: the murder of his own brother on Sergei's wedding day. The chapel remembers. The stones remember. And the curse that followed transformed this holy place into its opposite—a monument to damnation, a warning that even the most sacred places can be corrupted by evil strong enough and hatred deep enough.

Strahd rarely visits the chapel. Perhaps even he finds it too painful a reminder of what he lost and what he became. But the chapel remains as he left it three centuries ago: broken, bloodstained, and utterly forsaken.
