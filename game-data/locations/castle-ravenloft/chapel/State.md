# Castle Ravenloft - Chapel - Current State

The Chapel of Castle Ravenloft stands in silent testimony to Strahd's fall from grace. The chamber is empty and cold, with the oppressive spiritual weight of centuries-old desecration pressing down on everything. The broken pews lie where they fell, smashed in some ancient rage. Tattered altar cloth pools around the bloodstained marble altar—bloodstains that three centuries of time have failed to cleanse.

On either side of the altar, the stone tombs of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia von Zarovich rise from the floor, their surfaces marked with claw scratches that hint at violence even in death. The stained glass windows filter wan light into disturbing patterns, their altered panels chronicling Strahd's damnation in glass and lead.

The chapel remembers. The stones remember the wedding that ended in murder, the bride who fell to her death, the brother who died at the altar. Occasionally, whispers echo through the chamber—fragments of voices long dead, eternal echoes of trauma too profound to ever fully fade.

Two wraiths sleep within the tombs, bound to protect Strahd's parents even in undeath. They will not stir unless the tombs are disturbed. Hidden beneath the altar, in a secret compartment stained with ancient blood, lies the dagger Strahd used to murder Sergei—preserved as grim evidence of the moment when everything changed.

Divine magic struggles to reach this place. The corruption here is so deep that even the gods find it difficult to manifest their power through the spiritual static of desecration. Clerics and paladins who enter feel their connection to their deities strain and weaken, as if they stand at the edge of a void that hungers to swallow all light.

Strahd rarely visits the chapel. Perhaps even he finds it too painful a reminder of what he lost and what he became. But the chapel waits, remembering, whispering its eternal lament to anyone who will listen.

No one has yet entered this cursed sanctu ary. But that is about to change.
