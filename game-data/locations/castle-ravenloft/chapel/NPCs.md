# NPCs in Castle Ravenloft - Chapel

## Overview
The chapel is typically empty of NPCs, as even Strahd's undead servants find it uncomfortable. However, certain undead may be encountered here, and Strahd himself may appear if he wishes to torment visitors with tales of his past.

## Restless Spirits (Atmospheric)
- **Type:** Spectral echoes (non-combat)
- **CR:** N/A
- **Status:** Always present, but intangible
- **Location:** Throughout chapel (K15)
- **Behavior:** Whisper fragments of Strahd's wedding massacre, weep, moan
- **Dialogue:** Fragments only—"The bride... she fell..." "Blood on the altar..." "He killed his own brother..." "Why? Why did he do it?"

### Description
Characters with passive Perception 13 or higher occasionally hear whispers and weeping echoing through the chapel. These are not ghosts in the traditional sense—they are echoes of trauma so profound that it left impressions on the very stones. The chapel remembers the wedding massacre, and these sounds are its eternal lament.

**Effect:** DC 12 Wisdom saving throw when first heard or suffer disadvantage on next ability check (unsettled).

## Count Strahd von Zarovich (Possible Encounter)
- **Type:** Vampire (Legendary Creature)
- **CR:** 15
- **Status:** May appear here if he wishes to share his tragic backstory (20% chance if party enters)
- **Location:** Standing near altar or before his parents' tombs
- **Behavior:** Melancholic, reflective, dangerously unstable when discussing Sergei or Tatyana
- **Dialogue:** See parent castle-ravenloft/NPCs.md for full profile

### Chapel-Specific Dialogue
- **At the Altar:** "This is where it happened. My brother's wedding day. He took her from me—beautiful Tatyana, the only woman I ever loved. So I took everything from him. His life, his bride, his future. And in return, I received... eternity." [Gestures to bloodstained altar]
- **At Parents' Tombs:** "My father was a king. My mother was a queen. They gave me everything—title, land, power. But they could not give me the one thing I truly wanted. So I made a bargain. Do you know what I gave in exchange for eternal life? Everything. My soul. My humanity. My capacity for joy. Was it worth it? Ask me in another three centuries."
- **On Sergei:** "My brother was weak. Soft. He believed in love, honor, nobility—childish fantasies. I showed him the truth: power is all that matters. The strong take what they want. The weak die. He died weak. And I became strong." [Voice cracks slightly on "strong"]
- **If Players Show Sympathy:** "Do not pity me. I made my choice with open eyes. I regret nothing... except perhaps that Tatyana chose death over eternity with me. Every time she returns, she makes the same choice. Every. Single. Time."

### AI Behavior Notes for Chapel Encounter
- **Phase 1 (Reflective):** Strahd is melancholic and somewhat vulnerable here. He may share his backstory genuinely, seeking understanding (which he will never receive).
- **Unstable:** If party mentions Sergei positively or suggests Strahd was wrong, he becomes enraged. May attack immediately (no warning, no testing phase—straight to Phase 4 combat).
- **Test of Faith:** If cleric/paladin attempts to Turn Undead or consecrate altar, Strahd takes personal offense. "You dare? In MY home? I will show you the futility of your faith." Initiates combat.
- **Departure:** If encounter remains non-combat, Strahd eventually departs: "Enough reminiscence. The past is dead, and I am not. Enjoy your exploration. We shall meet again." [Turns to mist, flows through walls]

## Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (Possible Artifact Location)
If Tarokka reading places the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind in the chapel, it manifests as a spectral guardian:

### Spectral Guardian
- **Type:** Unique Entity (appears only if Holy Symbol here)
- **CR:** N/A (non-combat, but tests party)
- **Status:** Manifests when party attempts to claim Holy Symbol
- **Location:** Appears before altar (K15)
- **Behavior:** Tests party's worthiness through riddles or trials
- **Dialogue:** "The symbol of light lies defiled in this place of darkness. Prove yourselves worthy, and I shall guide you to it. Fail, and remain in ignorance."

**Test:** DC 15 Religion check to answer questions about the Morninglord's teachings, OR DC 17 Persuasion check to demonstrate pure intentions.
**Success:** Guardian reveals Holy Symbol's location (hidden in altar compartment beneath dagger).
**Failure:** Guardian fades: "Return when you are ready." Holy Symbol remains hidden (DC 20 Investigation to find without guardian's help).

## Encounter Notes
**Normal State:** Chapel is empty but spiritually oppressive. Restless whispers create unsettling atmosphere.

**Tombs Disturbed:** Wraith guardians animate and attack (CR 5 encounter × 1-2 wraiths).

**Combat Alerted:** Vampire spawn arrive as reinforcements after 3 rounds of combat.

**Strahd Presence (20% chance):** If Strahd present, he dominates the encounter. May share backstory or attack if provoked. This location triggers melancholic/unstable mood—dangerous combination.

**Divine Magic Suppression:** All divine spells require DC 15-17 spellcasting check (see Description.md). This significantly weakens cleric/paladin party members.
