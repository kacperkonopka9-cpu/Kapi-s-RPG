# Castle Ravenloft - Tower of Strahd - Current State

Strahd's tower stands silent, its secrets hidden behind locked doors and magical wards. The study waits with its books, scrolls, and dangerous artifacts. The portrait of Tatyana hangs above the fireplace, her painted eyes watching eternally. The Heart of Sorrow pulses at the tower's summit, its crimson glow visible through arrow slits, beating in rhythm with Strahd's immortal vitality.

At night, Strahd often works here—studying, scrying, searching for escape from his curse. By day, the tower is typically empty, guarded only by magical defenses. But whether he is present or absent, this tower is his soul laid bare: his obsession, his power, his vulnerabilities.

The Heart of Sorrow continues its eternal pulse, absorbing damage, keeping its master alive. As long as it exists, Strahd is significantly harder to kill. Destroying it would be a major victory—and would earn Strahd's undying hatred.

No one has yet penetrated this sanctum. But the artifacts within are worth any risk.
