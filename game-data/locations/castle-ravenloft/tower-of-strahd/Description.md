# Castle Ravenloft - Tower of Strahd

## Overview
The Tower of Strahd represents the vampire lord's most private sanctum—his study, personal chambers, and the location of the Heart of Sorrow, a pulsing crystal artifact that absorbs damage dealt to him. This tower complex includes Strahd's spellbooks, research notes, personal treasures, and possibly the Tome of Strahd. Accessing this area means penetrating to the very heart of Strahd's power, and he defends it accordingly with wards, guardians, and traps.

## Initial Description
You ascend a spiral staircase and emerge into a circular chamber fifty feet in diameter—Strahd's personal study. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the curved walls, crammed with ancient tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts. A massive oak desk dominates the center, covered in open books, parchments, quills, and alchemical instruments. A globe of Toril sits on one corner, and a crystal ball rests on a velvet pillow on the other.

The chamber is lit by everburning torches and a crackling fireplace that provides no warmth. Above the mantle hangs a portrait of a beautiful woman with auburn hair and haunting eyes—Tatyana, Strahd's eternal obsession. Her painted gaze seems to follow you, melancholic and accusatory.

A spiral staircase continues upward to the tower's peak. Through a narrow doorway, you glimpse Strahd's private bedchamber—a coffin on a raised dais (not his true resting place), black silk curtains, and furnishings of exquisite but morbid taste.

At the highest point of the tower (K20), visible through arrow-slit windows, a crimson glow pulses like a heartbeat. This is the Heart of Sorrow—a massive crystal heart suspended in arcane energies, pulsing with stolen life force. As long as it exists, Strahd is significantly harder to kill.

## Return Description
You return to Strahd's tower. The study remains as you left it—books open on the desk, the portrait of Tatyana watching silently. The Heart of Sorrow continues its rhythmic pulsing above (unless destroyed). This is Strahd's inner sanctum, and he knows when intruders enter. Expect him to respond swiftly and violently to any incursion here.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning light filters weakly through arrow slits, illuminating dust motes in the study. The books and scrolls are clearly visible—a scholar's paradise or a necromancer's library, depending on perspective. The Heart of Sorrow's glow is less pronounced in daylight but still visible, pulsing crimson against the pale sky.

### Day
The study is well-lit during the day, and you can examine Strahd's research in detail. His spellbooks are here (3 volumes, see Items.md), along with centuries of notes on necromancy, divination, and the nature of his curse. The portrait of Tatyana is hauntingly beautiful in natural light—her expression seems to shift between longing and despair.

### Night
At night, the tower becomes Strahd's command center. He often works here, studying, scrying, and planning. The Heart of Sorrow glows brightly against the darkness, its pulse synced to Strahd's own heartbeat (if he has one). If party enters at night, 80% chance Strahd is present, either in study or private chambers. Combat here will be brutal—Strahd fights ferociously to defend his sanctum.

## Rooms and Areas

### K20: Heart of Sorrow (Tower Summit)
The most critical location. A huge crystal heart (10 feet tall) hovers in the center of a small chamber, suspended by magical energy. It pulses with crimson light, beating in rhythm with Strahd's vitality.
