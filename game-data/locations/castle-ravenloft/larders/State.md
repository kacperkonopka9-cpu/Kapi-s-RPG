# Castle Ravenloft - Larders - Current State

The dungeons wait in silence, cells locked, prisoners (if any) huddled in corners. Rahadin's office stands organized and efficient, ledgers documenting centuries of suffering. Torture devices line the walls, ready for use. The elevator trap waits to send unwary intruders plummeting to the catacombs below.

This area represents the practical application of Strahd's evil—not grand gestures, but methodical cruelty maintained over centuries.
