# Castle Ravenloft - Larders (Dungeons)

## Overview
The larders and dungeons of Castle Ravenloft serve as prison, torture chamber, and feeding ground for Strahd's vampire spawn. This area includes Rahadin's office (K72), dungeon halls with cells containing prisoners (both living and undead), and the infamous elevator trap that descends to the catacombs.

## Initial Description
You descend into the castle's lower levels, where the air grows thick with the stench of unwashed bodies, blood, and despair. The dungeon halls are lined with iron-barred cells, some empty, some containing skeletal remains, and a few containing living prisoners—hollow-eyed wretches who have lost all hope.

Torture devices line the walls: iron maidens, racks, braziers with red-hot pokers, and chains suspended from the ceiling. The stones are stained with centuries of blood. Screams echo faintly through the corridors—whether from current victims or echoes of past torments is impossible to tell.

At the hall's end (K72), Rahadin's office serves as a command center. The dusk elf chamberlain keeps meticulous records of prisoners, their crimes (real or imagined), and their fates. His desk is covered in ledgers documenting three centuries of suffering.

## Return Description
You return to the dungeons. The cells wait, the torture devices stand ready, and Rahadin's office remains perfectly organized. This area represents Strahd's cruelty in its most practical form—not dramatic evil, but methodical, bureaucratic suffering.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Pale light filters through high barred windows. The prisoners are more visible now—gaunt figures who shy away from even this weak sunlight. Their suffering is stark in daylight.

### Day
The dungeons are slightly less oppressive during the day. Guards (vampire spawn or mongrelfolk) make rounds, feeding prisoners (barely enough to survive). Screams from torture sessions echo through halls.

### Night
At night, the vampire spawn feed on prisoners. Screams intensify. Rahadin works late in his office. Strahd may visit to personally interrogate valuable prisoners. Danger level increases significantly.

## Atmosphere
The dungeons embody bureaucratic evil—suffering processed efficiently, documented meticulously, and continued indefinitely. Rahadin runs this operation with cold professionalism, viewing prisoners as resources to be managed rather than people to be pitied.
