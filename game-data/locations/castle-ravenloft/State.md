# Castle Ravenloft - Current State

Castle Ravenloft stands as it has for centuries—silent, menacing, waiting. The gates remain closed, the drawbridge raised, the windows dark. No smoke rises from the chimneys, no guards patrol the battlements, no signs of life disturb the oppressive stillness.

Inside, Count Strahd von Zarovich rests in his study or wanders the shadowy halls, eternally vigilant for intruders. His vampire spawn servants maintain their posts, animated armor stands ready in alcoves, and the castle itself seems to pulse with malevolent awareness. The Heart of Sorrow, a crystal artifact of dark magic housed in Strahd's tower, beats with stolen life-force, providing its master with additional protection against those who would destroy him.

The catacombs below hold the remains of the Zarovich family and countless victims. The treasury hoards centuries of plunder. The larders contain prisoners both living and dead. And somewhere within these cursed walls lie the legendary artifacts that may provide the only means to defeat the vampire lord permanently.

The castle waits. The master waits. And when visitors finally arrive, whether through invitation or trespass, Castle Ravenloft will spring to terrible life—a labyrinth of death commanded by one of the most powerful vampires to ever exist.

No party has yet disturbed this ancient evil. But that is about to change.
