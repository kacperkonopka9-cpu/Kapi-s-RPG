# Castle Ravenloft - Dining Hall - Current State

The dining hall waits in silence, the massive banquet table set with an elaborate feast that has not decayed in centuries—because it was never real. Twenty high-backed chairs stand ready for guests who never come. At the head of the table, an ornate throne bears the von Zarovich coat of arms, waiting for its master.

The candles burn with steady flames, casting warm light that promises comfort but delivers only false hope. Above, hidden in the walls near the ceiling, arrow slits mark the locations of archer posts—insurance against guests who prove troublesome. The tapestries on the walls depict feasts and celebrations, but their disturbing details reveal the truth: hollow-eyed celebrants consuming ash, black wine flowing into goblets, false smiles masking terror.

The illusory feast glistens on silver platters—roasted meats, fresh fruits, crusty bread, deep red wine in crystal goblets. It looks perfect, smells appetizing (though the scent too is illusion), and promises sustenance. But touch it, and it transforms instantly to what it always was: ash, dust, cobwebs, and decay.

This hall embodies Strahd's philosophy—hospitality as weapon, welcome as trap. When he invites visitors to dine, it is both honor and trial. He may converse genuinely, testing their wit. Or he may simply watch as they discover the feast is false. Or he may give a subtle signal, and arrows rain from above.

The phantom servants move invisibly through the hall, maintaining the illusion of a functioning household. They dust, arrange, light candles, and prepare for guests who may never arrive—or who may never leave.

No one has yet accepted Strahd's invitation to dine. But the table is set. The throne waits. And when guests finally arrive, the count will be an impeccable host—right up until the moment he isn't.
