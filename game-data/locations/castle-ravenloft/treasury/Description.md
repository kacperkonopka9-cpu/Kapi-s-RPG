# Castle Ravenloft - Treasury

## Overview
The treasury is Strahd's treasure vault containing centuries of plunder: gold, gems, art, magic items, and possibly the Sunsword. Heavily trapped and guarded, this represents accumulated wealth of three centuries of conquest.

## Initial Description
You enter a reinforced chamber (40 feet × 30 feet) with stone walls two feet thick. Iron-banded chests line the walls, locked and warded. Shelves display art objects, statues, and relics. A central vault (10-foot cube of solid iron with complex lock) dominates the room. The air smells of metal and old gold.

## Return Description
The treasury remains as you left it—locked chests, art displays, the central vault. This is three centuries of accumulated treasure, waiting to be claimed or destroyed in Strahd's final defeat.

## Time-Based Variants
### Morning/Day
Treasury is typically unguarded during day (Strahd confident in locks and traps).

### Night
Possible guardian presence (wraith or animated armor). Strahd may check on treasury during nightly rounds (20% chance).

## Rooms and Areas
### K41: Treasury (Main Vault)
Main chamber with locked chests, art displays, central vault.

### K78: Brazier Room (Access Point)
Side access with braziers, additional guards or traps.

## Points of Interest
- **Central Vault** - 10-foot iron cube, DC 20 to pick lock or DC 25 to force, contains most valuable items
- **Locked Chests** - 20+ chests (DC 15-18 locks), various treasures
- **Art Displays** - Statues, paintings, relics on shelves
- **Traps** - Poison needle locks, alarm glyphs, collapsing ceiling

## Atmosphere
Concentrated wealth. Every item represents a conquest, a victim, or a plundered realm. This is Strahd's material legacy—empty of meaning but rich in gold.
