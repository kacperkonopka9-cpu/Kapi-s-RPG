# Castle Ravenloft - Treasury - Current State

The treasury waits, sealed and heavily trapped. Iron-banded chests line the walls. Art objects gleam on shelves. The central vault (10-foot iron cube) dominates the chamber, containing Strahd's most valuable treasures. This is three centuries of accumulated wealth—gold, gems, art, magic items, and possibly the Sunsword. All locked, trapped, and waiting to be claimed.
