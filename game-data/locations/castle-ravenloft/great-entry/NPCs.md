# NPCs in Castle Ravenloft - Great Entry Hall

## Overview
The Great Entry Hall typically hosts animated guardians rather than living NPCs, but it is a favored location for Strahd to make dramatic appearances. This is where he descends the grand staircase to greet "guests" with charm and veiled menace.

## Animated Armor Guardians
- **Type:** Animated Armor (Construct)
- **CR:** 1
- **Count:** 2d4 suits in alcoves along walls
- **Status:** Dormant until castle alerted or Strahd commands activation
- **Location:** Standing in alcoves along both walls of K8
- **Behavior:** Activate when intruders attempt to ascend grand staircase or open specific doors
- **Dialogue:** None (mindless constructs)

### Combat Stats
- **AC:** 18 (plate armor)
- **HP:** 33 (6d8 + 6)
- **Speed:** 25 ft.
- **Attacks:** Multiattack—Two Slam attacks (+4, 1d6+2 bludgeoning)

### AI Behavior Notes
- Activate in pairs when triggered (2 suits at a time, every 2 rounds another pair activates)
- Form defensive line at base of grand staircase to prevent ascent
- Prioritize grappling spellcasters (attempt to drag them away from party)
- Fight until destroyed (no morale, no retreat)
- If all armor destroyed, Strahd is notified via castle awareness

## Count Strahd von Zarovich (Primary Encounter Location)
- **Type:** Vampire (Legendary Creature)
- **CR:** 15
- **Status:** May appear here to greet visitors (50% chance on first entry, 30% on subsequent)
- **Location:** Descends grand staircase or emerges from shadows near organ
- **Behavior:** Grand, theatrical entrance; charming but menacing; assesses party
- **Dialogue:** See parent castle-ravenloft/NPCs.md for full profile

### Great Entry Hall Specific Dialogue
- **Grand Entrance:** "Ah, visitors. How delightful. Welcome to my home. I am Count Strahd von Zarovich, and you are my guests." [Descends staircase with inhuman grace, cloak billowing]
- **Organ Commentary:** "Do you appreciate the music? It is one of my few remaining pleasures—that, and the occasional... visit from brave souls such as yourselves."
- **Tapestry Reference:** "These tapestries chronicle the triumphs of House von Zarovich. Three centuries of victory, conquest, and... inevitable dominion. You stand in the hall of kings. Show proper respect."
- **Testing Party:** "You carry interesting items. That sword—may I see it? No? How rude. I shall remember your discourtesy when we meet again."
- **Departure:** "Please, explore my castle. Make yourselves at home. I have business to attend to, but I shall be watching. Always watching." [Transforms to mist and flows through wall]

### AI Behavior Notes for Great Entry Hall
- **Phase 1 (First Encounter):** Strahd appears to greet party, assess strength, and establish dominance. NO combat unless party attacks first.
- **Testing:** Uses Charm Person on character with highest Charisma. If successful, commands minor action ("Kneel," "Disarm yourself"). Releases after 1 round to prove power.
- **Psychological Warfare:** Comments on party's equipment, references their past actions (scrying), identifies threats (spellcasters, paladins, clerics).
- **Lair Action (Demonstration):** On initiative count 20, causes one door to slam shut and lock, or causes organ to play discordant notes (DC 12 Wisdom save or frightened for 1 round). Demonstrates castle obeys his will.
- **No Death Battle Here:** If attacked, Strahd defends for 2-3 rounds (to show he is not helpless), then transforms to mist and departs. "Impudent. You will regret that. I promise you." Advances to Phase 2 (Testing) prematurely.
- **Aftermath:** After Strahd departs, party may explore freely. Castle remains on alert. Next encounter will be more hostile.

## Invisible Stalker (Rare Encounter)
- **Type:** Invisible Stalker (Elemental)
- **CR:** 6
- **Status:** Deployed by Strahd if party proves particularly dangerous
- **Location:** Follows party through castle, observing and reporting
- **Behavior:** Does NOT attack unless commanded; purely reconnaissance
- **Dialogue:** None (silent observer)

### AI Behavior Notes
- Strahd summons stalker via casting spell (8th level slot)
- Stalker remains invisible, following party at 30-foot distance
- Reports back to Strahd via telepathic bond every 10 minutes
- Provides Strahd with real-time intelligence: party tactics, spells used, resources expended
- If detected (DC 20 Perception due to invisibility), stalker withdraws and reports detection
- Only attacks if party attempts to long rest in castle (prevents rest)

## Phantom Servants (Atmospheric NPCs)
- **Type:** Unseen servants (permanent Unseen Servant spells)
- **CR:** N/A (non-combat)
- **Status:** Always active throughout castle
- **Location:** Move invisibly through halls, performing servant tasks
- **Behavior:** Dust furniture, arrange items, light torches, close doors
- **Dialogue:** None (invisible and intangible)

### Description
Occasionally, party members notice objects moving on their own: a candelabra being polished by invisible hands, a door closing gently after they pass, dust being swept from the grand staircase. These are Strahd's phantom servants—permanent Unseen Servant spells that maintain the castle in his absence. They are harmless but deeply unnerving.

**Effect:** DC 10 Wisdom saving throw when first noticed or suffer disadvantage on next ability check (startled by movement).

## Encounter Notes
**First Visit:** 50% chance Strahd appears to greet party. If not, organ begins playing when party enters (automatic).

**Subsequent Visits:** 30% chance Strahd appears. If castle on alert, 2d4 animated armor activate instead.

**Combat Consequences:** Fighting in Great Entry Hall alerts entire castle. Vampire spawn from guest-quarters (2d3) arrive in 1d4+1 rounds. Strahd learns of combat immediately via castle awareness.

**Tactical Importance:** Great Entry Hall is Strahd's preferred location for first encounter. It demonstrates his power (lair actions, organ, armor), allows theatrical entrance (staircase), and provides excellent escape routes (many doors, secret passages, mist form through walls).
