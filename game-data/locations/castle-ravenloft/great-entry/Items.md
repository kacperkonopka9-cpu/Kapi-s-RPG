## Integration Notes
All items use Epic 3 Item Database schema. When items are discovered or collected:
1. Update State.md `discovered_items` array
2. Trigger relevant events (e.g., activating secret passages)
3. If Tome of Strahd is found, trigger major quest update
4. Looting tapestries or portrait alerts Strahd (he notices via scrying or phantom servants)

**DM Note:** Great Entry Hall treasures are primarily decorative/artistic. This reinforces Strahd's wealth and cultured nature. Functional combat loot is limited (potions, swords) to encourage players to push deeper into castle rather than looting early areas extensively.
