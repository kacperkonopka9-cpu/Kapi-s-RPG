# Castle Ravenloft - Great Entry Hall - Current State

The Great Entry Hall stands silent and imposing, waiting for its first visitors. The vast chamber stretches eighty feet long and fifty feet wide, its vaulted ceiling disappearing into darkness sixty feet above. The massive pipe organ sits on its elevated platform at the far end, its silver pipes gleaming faintly in the gloom. Tattered tapestries hang on the walls, depicting centuries of von Zarovich conquests. Suits of armor stand motionless in alcoves, their visors dark and empty.

The grand staircase sweeps up the western wall, splitting into two branches that lead to shadowed galleries above. The black marble floor reflects distorted images like a dark mirror. The temperature is cold enough to mist breath, and the air is thick with dust and the scent of decay.

No torches burn. No servants tend the hall. No sound disturbs the oppressive silence. But this silence is illusory—the organ may begin playing at any moment, the armor may animate to block escape routes, and the tapestries conceal spy-holes through which unseen watchers observe all who enter.

This hall is designed to overwhelm visitors with its scale and grandeur, to demonstrate that they have entered a place of power beyond their comprehension. The master of this castle has had three centuries to perfect every detail, and nothing in this hall exists without purpose.

The organ bench waits empty. The tapestries hang motionless. The armor stands ready. And somewhere high above, in galleries shrouded in shadow, pale eyes may already be watching, patient and infinitely dangerous.

No one has yet disturbed this ancient hall. But that is about to change.
