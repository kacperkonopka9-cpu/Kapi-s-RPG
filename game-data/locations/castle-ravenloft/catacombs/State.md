# Castle Ravenloft - Catacombs - Current State

The catacombs wait in darkness beneath the castle. Dozens of coffins line the alcoves, some sealed, some shattered from within. Sergei's tomb stands as a beacon of peace in the center, its marble surface gleaming faintly. In the deepest alcove, Strahd's coffin rests—black lacquered wood, immaculate, waiting to receive its master.

The undead guardians sleep in their alcoves, ready to rise when intruders approach the master's resting place. The air is thick with death, cold, oppressive. This is where Strahd is most vulnerable—and most dangerous.

The final battle will be fought here. This is where legends are made or heroes fall.
