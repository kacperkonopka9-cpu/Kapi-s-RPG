# Castle Ravenloft - Catacombs

## Overview
The Catacombs of Castle Ravenloft are the ancient crypts beneath the castle, housing the tombs of the Zarovich family and countless victims. This is where Strahd's coffin rests (K86)—his true resting place. To destroy Strahd permanently, the party must stake him in his coffin or expose him to sunlight here. This is the final battle location, defended by powerful undead and Strahd himself at his most desperate.

## Initial Description
You descend into the catacombs—a maze of stone corridors lined with alcoves containing ancient coffins and sarcophagi. The air is thick with the stench of earth, decay, and old death. Water drips from the ceiling, pooling on the stone floor. The temperature is bone-chilling, and your breath mists in the frigid air.

Dozens of alcoves line the walls, each holding a coffin bearing the von Zarovich or von Roeyen family names. Some coffins are sealed with iron bands and holy symbols (long since corrupted). Others have been shattered from within, their occupants having risen as undead centuries ago.

At the center of the catacombs (K85) stands an ornate marble tomb—Sergei's resting place. Strahd's brother, murdered on his wedding day, lies here in eternal rest. The tomb radiates a faint aura of peace, a stark contrast to the corruption surrounding it.

Beyond Sergei's tomb, hidden in the deepest alcove (K86), rests Strahd's coffin. Unlike the others, this coffin is immaculate: black lacquered wood with silver fittings and red velvet interior. This is where Strahd retreats when reduced to 0 HP, where he regenerates over 8 hours. This is where he must be destroyed.

## Return Description
You return to the catacombs. The oppressive weight of death presses down. Sergei's tomb stands as a beacon of peace in the darkness. Strahd's coffin waits in its hidden alcove, ready to receive its master should he fall in battle. This is the endgame location—the place where Strahd will make his final stand or meet his final death.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Pale light filters weakly through high, narrow shafts from above. The catacombs are slightly less oppressive in daylight, but still deeply hostile. Strahd rests in his coffin during the day (8 hours after taking damage). If party finds him during day-rest, he is vulnerable—paralyzed in coffin, can be staked without combat. But reaching him requires fighting through all guardians.

### Day
The catacombs remain dark even at noon, lit only by faint shafts of indirect light. Undead guardians are active regardless of time. Strahd sleeps in coffin if recovering from previous night's damage.

### Night
At night, the catacombs become Strahd's fortress. He commands all undead here with perfect coordination. If party reaches his coffin at night while he's active elsewhere, he returns immediately (arrives in 1d4 rounds). Final battle will be here, with full lair actions and legendary actions.

## Rooms and Areas

### K84: Catacombs (Main Corridors)
Maze of stone corridors, alcoves with dozens of coffins. Some contain harmless remains, others contain undead guardians (wights, wraiths). DC 15 Perception to hear movement in sealed coffins (undead inside, waiting).

### K85: Sergei's Tomb
Ornate marble tomb in central chamber. Sergei von Zarovich rests here, Strahd's murdered brother. The tomb radiates faint divine aura (DC 13 Religion to identify as protective blessing). Undead cannot approach within 10 feet of this tomb. Party may rest here briefly (short rest only—longer rest triggers Strahd response).

### K86: Strahd's Coffin
Hidden alcove containing Strahd's true resting place. Black lacquered coffin with silver fittings, red velvet interior. This is where Strahd regenerates after being reduced to 0 HP. To destroy him permanently: (1) Stake him in coffin, (2) Expose to sunlight while in coffin, (3) Prevent him from reaching coffin for 2 hours after 0 HP (rare).

### K87: Guardians' Chamber
Alcoves containing powerful undead bound to defend approach to Strahd's coffin. Wights (CR 3, 1d6+2) and/or Wraiths (CR 5, 1d4) activate when intruders approach K86.

### K88: Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia
Secondary tomb (if not in chapel) containing Strahd's parents. Guarded by wraiths (1-2, CR 5). May contain treasure or family artifacts.

## Atmosphere
The catacombs are the culmination of Strahd's curse—where he rests, where he is most vulnerable, and where he will fight most desperately. Every undead here serves one purpose: defend the master's coffin. This is where heroes become legends or corpses.
