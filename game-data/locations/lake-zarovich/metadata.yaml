lore_significance: |
  Lake Zarovich is where Arabelle's rescue occurs—a critical moment in Vistani relations. Bluto's madness represents how Barovian desperation can turn ordinary people into monsters. The rescue (or failure) determines whether Vistani become allies or enemies.

dm_notes: |
  Lake Zarovich is designed as tense, low-combat encounter. Bluto is CR 0 but creates drama via hostage situation. Time pressure (Arabelle drowning) forces quick decisions. Success dramatically improves Vistani relations. Failure has lasting consequences.

  Hostage Negotiation Tips:
  - Bluto is insane but not inherently evil—driven mad by starvation and superstition
  - DC 13 Persuasion is achievable but not trivial
  - Combat causes him to panic and drop Arabelle (increases rescue difficulty)
  - *Charm Person*, *Suggestion*, or other social magic trivializes encounter
  - Physical rescue (swimming) creates athletic challenge

  Optional Lake Monster: Include only if party needs combat. Monster adds danger to otherwise peaceful location but risks overshadowing Arabelle rescue drama.
