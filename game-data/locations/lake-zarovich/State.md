# Lake Zarovich - Current State

## First Approach

The mist-shrouded lake stretches before the party. If they arrive during Arabelle's kidnapping (as directed by Luvash at Tser Pool), they see Bluto's boat 100 feet offshore. The mad fisherman holds the bound girl over dark waters, ranting about lake gods and sacrifices.

Time is critical. Arabelle's life depends on quick action—negotiation, rescue, or combat. One wrong move and she sinks into the cold depths.

## Strategic Objective

Rescue Arabelle from Bluto and return her safely to Luvash at Tser Pool.

## Current Situation

- **Bluto Krogarov**: 100 feet offshore in rowboat, holds Arabelle hostage
- **Arabelle**: Bound, gagged, terrified, about to be drowned
- **Water Depth**: 50+ feet (deep water, drowning risk)
- **Distance**: 100 feet swim from shore to boat

## Rescue Options

1. **Persuasion**: DC 13 to talk Bluto down (he releases her but she may still sink)
2. **Combat**: Attack Bluto (he panics and drops her—immediate rescue needed)
3. **Magic**: *Fly*, *Levitate*, *Water Breathing* trivialize rescue
4. **Swimming**: Athletics DC 12 to swim to boat, catch falling Arabelle, return to shore

## Time Pressure

- If Arabelle enters water, she sinks
- Drowning begins in 1d4 rounds
- Must reach her, stabilize, and return to shore quickly
- Swimming in armor imposes disadvantage

## Consequences

**Success**: Arabelle saved, return her to Luvash for reward and Vistani alliance
**Failure**: Arabelle drowns, Vistani curse the party, Luvash becomes enemy

## Notes

Lake Zarovich is simple location with single critical event. Success dramatically improves Vistani relations. Failure has lasting consequences (curse, enemy faction). Despite low danger level (CR 0 Bluto), hostage situation creates genuine tension.
