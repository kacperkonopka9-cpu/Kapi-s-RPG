# Lake Zarovich - Description

## Overview

Lake Zarovich is a vast, mist-shrouded lake north of Vallaki. Its dark waters reflect Barovia's oppressive sky. The lake serves as fishing grounds for desperate villagers and the site of Arabelle's rescue—the young Vistana girl kidnapped and nearly drowned by the mad fisherman Bluto Krogarov. Legends speak of a lake monster, though whether it truly exists or is merely superstition remains unclear.

The lake is relatively peaceful compared to other Barovian locations, but the Arabelle rescue quest creates time-sensitive drama and connects to the broader Vistana storyline from Tser Pool.

## Initial Description

Mist rolls across dark waters that stretch to the horizon. The lake is eerily calm, its surface like black glass. A rickety dock extends into the water, and a small rowboat bobs nearby. The air smells of algae and decay.

If arriving during Arabelle's kidnapping, the party sees Bluto's boat 100 feet offshore. The fisherman is attempting to drown the bound girl as "sacrifice to the lake god" to improve his catches.

## Return Description

On subsequent visits, the lake is peaceful. If Arabelle was rescued, the Vistani are grateful. If she drowned, the lake feels darker, more oppressive—the Vistani's curse hangs over the water.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning mist obscures visibility across the lake. Fish occasionally break the surface. Any boats on the water are clearly visible. Good time for fishing or searching for Bluto.

### Night
At night, the lake becomes foreboding. Mist thickens. Strange ripples suggest movement beneath—the lake monster, real or imagined. Not recommended for boat travel without light sources.

## Points of Interest

### The Fishing Dock
A weathered dock with mooring posts. Bluto's boat is tied here when he's not attempting murder. Local fishermen use this dock, though catches have been poor (hence Bluto's desperation).

### Bluto's Boat
A small rowboat containing fishing nets, tackle, and evidence of Bluto's deteriorating mental state (muttered prayers to "the lake god," tally marks of failed fishing days).

### Offshore Waters
100 feet from shore during Arabelle event. Deep water (50+ feet) with poor visibility. Swimming requires Athletics checks. Boat travel is safer but slow.

### Submerged Ruins
DC 18 Perception from boat reveals stone structures beneath the surface—ruins of pre-Strahd civilization. Accessible only via diving or water-breathing magic. Contains minor treasure but risky.

### Lake Monster Lair (Optional)
If DM includes lake monster, its lair is in deepest waters. Large catfish or possibly something more sinister (aquatic undead, giant pike, etc.). Mostly rumors.

## Environmental Hazards

- Deep water (drowning risk)
- Cold temperatures (hypothermia after 10+ minutes)
- Poor visibility (mist)
- Lake monster (if DM includes it, CR 3-5)
- Bluto Krogarov during rescue (CR 0 commoner but has hostage)
