# Wizard of Wines Winery - Description

## Overview

The Wizard of Wines Winery is Barovia's sole producer of wine, a family-run vineyard operated for ten generations by the Martikov family—secretly wereravens and members of the Keepers of the Feather. The winery produces three varieties of wine from magically enhanced vines: Purple Grapemash, Red Dragon Crush, and Champagne du Stompe. When the party arrives, the winery is under siege by druids and blights serving Strahd, seeking to destroy Barovia's last source of comfort and joy. The Martikov family has fled, leaving behind their livelihood and the three magic gems that keep their vines productive—two of which have already been stolen.

## Initial Description

The winery complex spreads across a hillside terraced with grapevines. Stone walls enclose the central buildings: a large main house combining family quarters and winery operations, a fermentation building with its distinctive rounded roof, a loading yard with wine barrels stacked and ready for delivery, and worker cottages scattered around the perimeter. Normally, this would be a scene of industrious activity—harvest, pressing, bottling, shipping. But not today.

The vineyard is overrun. Dozens of twisted plant creatures—twig blights and needle blights—move through the rows of vines, tearing down trellises and destroying plants with methodical cruelty. Druids in bark-like armor command the assault, their reverence for nature twisted into worship of Strahd as a force of eternal stasis. They seek to destroy the winery because it represents life, growth, and sustenance—everything their dark master opposes.

The main winery building's doors and windows are barricaded from within. Smoke rises from the chimney, suggesting someone remains inside, trapped by the siege. Broken barrels litter the loading yard, wine soaking into the earth like spilled blood. The fermentation building's door hangs open, and shadows move within—blights have infiltrated the core of the operation.

In the distance, beyond the vineyard rows, an ancient stone circle on a hill called Yester Hill can be seen. Dark figures gather there, conducting rituals that fuel the blight assault. Ravens circle overhead—the Keepers of the Feather watching their ancestral home fall to corruption, unable to intervene without revealing their true nature.

The vineyard's magic is failing. Normally, the vines glow with subtle enchantment, but that light is fading. Without the three magic gems that power the vineyard's prosperity, the vines weaken, and Barovia's wine supply—one of the few remaining sources of comfort in this cursed land—will cease forever.

## Return Description

The winery's condition depends on your previous actions. If you drove off the druids and blights, the Martikov family has returned and begun repairs. Broken trellises are being rebuilt, destroyed vines cleared away, and the winery operations slowly resume. If you recovered the stolen gems, the vineyard's magic glows brighter, and the family's gratitude is evident in their warm welcome. If the siege continues or you failed to secure the gems, the devastation deepens—more vines dead, buildings looted, and hope fading from the Martikov family's eyes.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Dawn over the winery reveals the full extent of the devastation. Morning light illuminates broken vines, trampled rows, and the blight creatures that stand motionless until activated. Mist rises from the valley below, wreathing the vineyard in fog that slowly burns away as the sun climbs higher. This is the best time to assess the situation—blights are dormant, druids may be sleeping or conducting morning rituals at Yester Hill, and the Martikov family (if rescued) begins their day's work with typical wereraven efficiency. The loading yard is most accessible in morning light, and infiltration is easier when enemies are less active.

### Night

After dark, the winery becomes far more dangerous. Blight creatures become more active and aggressive, moving through the vineyard with predatory purpose. Druids chant at Yester Hill, their dark rituals empowering the blights and calling forth more corrupted plants from the earth. The vineyard's failing magic creates eerie luminescence—dying enchantments flickering like ghostly lights among the vines. This is when wereravens patrol in raven form, watching for opportunities to reclaim their home. The fermentation building's interior becomes pitch black, perfect for ambushes. Strange sounds echo from the forests surrounding the vineyard—wolves howl, owls screech, and the wind carries whispers in Druidic. Night is the worst time to attack but necessary if stealth is your strategy.

## Points of Interest

### Main Winery Building

The heart of the operation, this three-story stone structure combines family living quarters, wine production workspace, and storage cellars. The ground floor features the pressing room where grapes become juice, the bottling area where wine is prepared for sale, and the tasting room where customers sample vintages. The second floor contains the Martikov family's living quarters—bedrooms, common room, and Davian's office filled with records of ten generations of winemaking. The third floor serves as storage for finished products and aging barrels.

Currently, the building is barricaded and besieged. If Martikovs are still inside when party arrives, they're running out of food and hope, preparing for a last stand. If the family has fled, the building is partially looted by druids seeking wine for their own purposes or simply destroying it for spite. The wine cellar beneath holds the family's most precious vintages and, potentially, one of the missing magic gems if it hasn't been stolen yet.

### Fermentation Building

This distinctive rounded structure houses the fermentation vats where grape juice transforms into wine through carefully controlled magic and natural processes. Eight large wooden vats dominate the interior, connected by pipes and channels. Normally, this room hums with activity and smells of sweet fermentation. During the siege, it's been infiltrated by needle blights that hide among the vats and pipes, ready to ambush intruders.

The fermentation building also contains the family's secret: a hidden compartment where the three magic gems were stored. One gem remains here (if not yet stolen), embedded in a stone niche that radiates fading enchantment. The druids know about the gems and seek to steal or destroy them to permanently cripple the vineyard.

### Loading Yard and Storage

The outdoor area where wine barrels are staged for transport to Vallaki, Krezk, and other settlements. Under normal circumstances, this is a bustling workspace with wagons loading shipments and workers rolling barrels. During the siege, it's a battlefield. Dozens of barrels have been smashed, wine soaking into the dirt. The remaining intact barrels represent the last of the vineyard's inventory—if they're destroyed or stolen, the winery's business collapses even if the family survives.

A wagon sits partially loaded, abandoned when the attack began. Work tools—axes, hammers, pruning hooks—are scattered around, potential improvised weapons. The loading yard offers good sightlines across the vineyard, making it a strategic position for either defense or assault.

### Vineyard Rows

Acres of grapevines stretch across terraced hillsides, planted in orderly rows that follow the land's contours. Each variety has its own section: Purple Grapemash vines with their distinctive purple-black grapes, Red Dragon Crush vines bearing large scarlet fruit, and the rare Champagne du Stompe vines producing delicate golden grapes. Normally, these vines glow with subtle magic, the legacy of the three enchanted gems. During the siege, that magic is dying—vines wilt, grapes shrivel, and the very life drains from the vineyard.

Blights move between the rows like twisted scarecrows, methodically destroying decades of cultivation. Druids supervise the devastation, ensuring thorough obliteration. The vineyard terrain provides cover but also restricts movement—rows channel combat into narrow corridors, and tangled vines can trip unwary travelers. Hidden among the destruction are the family's tools, equipment, and personal items left behind during their flight.

### Worker Cottages

Four small stone buildings house seasonal workers and extended family members. These simple structures contain basic furnishings, personal belongings, and modest treasure. During the siege, some cottages have been burned by druids, others looted, and one is occupied by a druid commander using it as a field headquarters. If workers were present when the attack began, their fate is grim—captured, killed, or fled into the wilderness. Their belongings remain, along with notes, journals, and evidence of the normal life that existed before the siege.

### Wine Cellars (Underground)

Beneath the main building, accessed by stone stairs, lie the aging cellars where the finest vintages rest in cool darkness. Barrel after barrel of wine at various stages of maturity line the walls. This is the winery's true treasure—centuries of accumulated stock representing the Martikov family's wealth and Barovia's cultural heritage. The cellars also contain family secrets: a hidden shrine to the Morninglord (the Martikovs maintain faith despite Barovia's darkness), records of the Keepers of the Feather, and a concealed exit tunnel that leads to the vineyard's edge.

If the winery falls, these cellars become the druids' target for final desecration. If the party defends successfully, the cellars become a fortress—defendable, stocked with supplies, and offering escape routes. The atmosphere here is cool, dark, and heavy with the scent of aging wine.

### Yester Hill (Visible Distance)

Though not part of the winery proper, Yester Hill dominates the western view—a forested hill crowned with an ancient stone circle. This is where the druids conduct their rituals, drawing power from the gulthias tree (a corrupted tree grown from a vampire's stake) and a massive construct made from vines and corpses. The druids here are led by Strahd loyalists who view the vampire lord as an eternal force of nature. The hill represents the source of the threat—stopping the winery siege permanently requires dealing with the druids at their stronghold.

### Raven Perches

Throughout the winery grounds, unusually large numbers of ravens perch and watch. These are Keepers of the Feather members—wereraven allies observing the siege. They cannot reveal themselves without exposing the family's secret, but they're desperate for help. If the party proves capable and trustworthy, the ravens may reveal their true nature and offer alliance. They know the winery's layout, the druids' numbers, and where the stolen gems were taken. Ravens serve as eyes throughout the encounter, providing subtle assistance to those who oppose the druids.
