# NPCs in Wizard of Wines Winery

## Davian Martikov

- **Type:** Human (Wereraven) Winery Owner, Patriarch
- **Age:** 62
- **Location:** Trapped in winery or nearby forest (fled during siege)
- **Status:** Alive, desperate, protective of family and vineyard
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral initially, becomes loyal ally if winery saved
- **Quest Connection:** "Reclaim the Winery," "Recover the Magic Gems," "Stop the Druids"

### Description

Davian appears as a sturdy, weather-beaten man with silver-gray hair and sharp, intelligent eyes. He wears practical work clothes—leather vest, sturdy boots, and gloves permanently stained with grape juice. His hands are calloused from decades of vineyard work, and he moves with the confidence of someone who knows every inch of his land. Despite his age, he's vigorous and strong, the result of his wereraven nature.

His expression carries the weight of ten generations of family responsibility. The winery isn't just his business—it's his heritage, his identity, and his sacred trust. Watching it burn destroys him more than any physical wound could.

### Dialogue

- **Initial Plea:** "Please, you have to help us! The winery—it's all we have, all Barovia has! Those damned druids and their plant monsters are destroying everything! My family fled, but the vineyard... the vineyard is dying!"

- **About the Gems:** "The magic gems are our family's secret—three enchanted stones that make our vines thrive in this cursed land. Without them, the vineyard fails, the wine stops, and Barovia loses one of its few remaining comforts. The druids stole two already, took them to Yester Hill and Berez. The third... I hid it, but I don't know if it's still safe."

- **Revealing True Nature:** "You've proven trustworthy. I'll share the family secret: we're wereravens, members of the Keepers of the Feather. We've watched over Barovia for generations, opposing Strahd where we can. The winery is our base, our cover, and our way of helping people. If it falls, we lose everything."

- **After Rescue:** "You saved our family legacy! The Martikovs never forget their debts. You have our eternal friendship and the support of the Keepers of the Feather. Anything we can do, we will."
