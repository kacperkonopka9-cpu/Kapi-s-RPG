notes: "Wizard of Wines is quest-critical location representing major combat encounter, faction alliance opportunity, and economic keystone for Barovia. Siege involves 3 druids (CR 2 each) plus 32 blights—difficult battle requiring tactics. Fire-based attacks are extremely effective (blights vulnerable). Martikov family are wereravens (Keepers of the Feather secret society) who become devoted allies if saved. Three magic gems power vineyard: one hidden on-site (DC 15 to find), one stolen to Yester Hill (druid stronghold), one stolen to Berez (Baba Lysaga CR 11). Recovering all three gems restores full wine production. Wine shortage affects Vallaki, Krezk, and Village of Barovia—creates pressure on party to help. Location connects to multiple other areas: Yester Hill (follow-up dungeon), Berez (high-level encounter), Vallaki (Blue Water Inn/Adrian), settlements (wine deliveries). Keepers alliance provides intelligence network, safe houses, and wereraven assistance. Winery can be used as safe house after reclaiming. Economic component: party can earn commissions delivering wine (5-10 gp per barrel). Recommended approach: use fire against blights, defeat druid leaders first (they control blights), free Martikovs early for assistance, search fermentation building for first gem immediately."
