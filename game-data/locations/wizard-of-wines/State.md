# Wizard of Wines Winery - Current State

The winery is under siege. Druids in bark armor command dozens of twisted plant creatures that tear through the vineyard with methodical cruelty. Twig blights snap vine trellises, needle blights launch projectiles at the main building's barricaded windows, and the druids themselves oversee the destruction with fanatical satisfaction.

Inside the main winery building, the Martikov family has barricaded themselves. Davian, Elvir, and Stefania watch helplessly as generations of work are destroyed. Their supplies are running low, and they know the druids will eventually breach the doors. They've sent ravens to Adrian in Vallaki, desperate pleas for help that may or may not be answered.

The vineyard itself cries out silently. Rows of carefully tended grapevines—Purple Grapemash, Red Dragon Crush, and the rare Champagne du Stompe—are being systematically destroyed. The vines' magic is fading. Two of the three enchanted gems that powered the vineyard have been stolen: one taken to Yester Hill and embedded in the druids' cursed gulthias tree, another stolen by Baba Lysaga and carried to the swamp ruins of Berez. The third gem remains hidden in the fermentation building, but the druids search for it constantly.

Ravens circle overhead in unusual numbers. These aren't normal ravens—they're wereravens, members of the Keepers of the Feather, watching their home fall. They cannot reveal themselves without exposing the organization, but they desperately want to help. They watch, hoping someone capable will arrive to save the winery.

In the loading yard, broken wine barrels leak their contents into the earth like spilled blood. This is more than economic destruction—it's an assault on Barovia's spirit. Wine represents one of the few remaining comforts in this cursed land. Without it, despair deepens, and Strahd's victory becomes more complete.

The siege continues. Each day brings more destruction. Time is running out for the Wizard of Wines and the Martikov family's ten-generation legacy.
