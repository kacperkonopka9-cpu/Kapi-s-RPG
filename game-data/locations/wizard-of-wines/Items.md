## Notes

### Winery Economics
- Normally produces 50 barrels per month with all gems active
- With one gem: 15 barrels per month
- With two gems: 30 barrels per month
- Without any gems: 5 barrels per month, rapidly declining to zero
- Each barrel = 200 bottles, sellable at 5-50 gp per bottle depending on vintage

### Gem Recovery Priority
Recovering gems in order of importance:
1. **Gem #1 (Fermentation Building):** Easiest to secure, immediate partial restoration
2. **Gem #2 (Yester Hill):** Medium difficulty, requires defeating druid stronghold
3. **Gem #3 (Berez/Baba Lysaga):** Hardest recovery, CR 11 boss encounter

### Ethical Considerations
- Martikovs will let party keep loot from defeated druids/blights
- Personal family belongings should be returned to earn trust
- Wine in cellar is family's livelihood—taking it is theft
- Hidden Keeper records are sensitive—reading them is accepted if helping, but spreading information is betrayal
