# Argynvostholt - Description

## Overview

Argynvostholt stands as a ruined mansion overlooking the valley, once headquarters of the Order of the Silver Dragon—noble knights who opposed Strahd's tyranny. Now it houses revenants, undead warriors consumed by hatred for the vampire lord. Led by Vladimir Horngaard, these spirits refuse to pass on, their rage binding them to the mortal world. Ironically, their hatred has become so absolute they actively prevent Strahd's destruction, believing eternal torment is better than the release death would bring him.

The mansion contains the skull of Argynvost, the silver dragon who founded the order. If returned to the dragon's mausoleum and a beacon lit, the dragon's spirit might aid the party against Strahd—but Vladimir will oppose this, as it might give Strahd hope.

## Initial Description

The ruined mansion rises from overgrown grounds, its walls cracked and windows shattered. Gargoyles perch on the roof, some animate, most just weathered stone. The front gates hang open, creaking in the wind. Inside, furniture lies broken and scattered. Phantom warriors materialize in corridors, reliving ancient battles. Cold radiates from the walls—not winter cold, but the chill of undeath.

At the mansion's heart, a grand chapel holds Argynvost's skull—a massive silver dragon skull mounted above the altar, its empty eye sockets seeming to watch visitors with judgment.

## Return Description

The revenants remember those who've entered before. If the party proved honorable, Vladimir may negotiate. If they desecrated the mansion or attacked revenants, the spirits are hostile. The dragon's skull pulses with dim light if the party discussed restoring the beacon.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Daylight reveals the mansion's former glory—elegant architecture now fallen to ruin. The revenants become translucent, less solid, but no less dangerous. Gargoyles remain dormant unless approached.

### Night
At night, the revenants manifest fully. Phantom battles rage in the courtyard—echoes of the order's last stand against Strahd's forces. Vladimir walks the halls, muttering oaths of vengeance. The dragon's skull glows with spectral light.

## Points of Interest

### Grand Chapel
The chapel's centerpiece is Argynvost's skull—15 feet long, silver scales still gleaming. Mounted above a desecrated altar, it radiates faint divination magic. The skull is the key to lighting the beacon and summoning Argynvost's spirit.

### Vladimir's Chamber
The revenant leader's room contains military maps, battle plans against Strahd, and a journal detailing his philosophy: eternal torment for Strahd is superior to the release of death.

### Dragon Mausoleum
In the mansion's basement, Argynvost's body was originally entombed. The sarcophagus stands empty—the dragon's skull was removed and mounted in the chapel. Returning the skull here allows lighting the beacon.

### The Beacon Tower
The mansion's tower once held a magical beacon. If Argynvost's skull is returned to the mausoleum and a ritual performed, the beacon ignites, summoning the dragon's spirit to aid against Strahd. This grants the party a powerful blessing.

### Phantom Battlefields
Throughout the mansion, ghostly battles replay—revenants fight Strahd's forces eternally. These are harmless echoes unless disturbed, then they become hostile encounters.
