# Argynvostholt - Current State

## First Approach

The ruined mansion of the Order of the Silver Dragon awaits. Within, revenants consumed by hatred patrol endlessly, their leader Vladimir Horngaard so twisted by rage he opposes Strahd's destruction.

The dragon's skull holds the key to summoning Argynvost's spirit and gaining a powerful blessing against Strahd. But Vladimir will fight to prevent this, believing hope weakens his eternal vengeance.

The party must navigate revenant politics, convince or defeat Vladimir, and light the beacon to gain the dragon's aid.

## Strategic Objective

Return Argynvost's skull to the mausoleum and light the beacon to summon the dragon's spirit and receive his blessing (+1 AC and saves vs. Strahd).

## Current Threats

- Vladimir Horngaard (CR 5 revenant leader, opposes beacon)
- 12 revenant knights (CR 5 each, follow Vladimir)
- 4 animated gargoyles (CR 2 each)
- Unstable architecture

## Notes

Argynvostholt is less about combat and more about moral choice and negotiation. Parties can fight through, but clever negotiation with Godfrey or convincing Vladimir yields better results. The beacon's blessing is significant for the final confrontation with Strahd.
