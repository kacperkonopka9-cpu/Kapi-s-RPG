lore_significance: |
  The Order of the Silver Dragon was founded by Argynvost to oppose Strahd. They failed, and the dragon fell in battle. Now their spirits remain as revenants, consumed by hatred. Vladimir believes eternal torment for Strahd is superior to giving him the release of death.

dm_notes: |
  Argynvostholt tests negotiation and moral reasoning. Vladimir's philosophy (eternal torment > death) is twisted but not entirely wrong. Parties must decide: honor the revenants' wishes or light the beacon for tactical advantage. Godfrey represents the Order's original ideals and can become ally if party proves worthy.
