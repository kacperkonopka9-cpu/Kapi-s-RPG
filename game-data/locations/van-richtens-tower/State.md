# Van Richten's Tower - Current State

The tower rises from Lake Baratok's cold waters, shrouded in perpetual mist. Five stories of gray stone stand silent and sealed, keeping their secrets from the world. Near the shore, a colorful Vistani wagon sits among the trees—trapped and waiting for the unwary.

Inside, the tower is quiet. Van Richten departed weeks ago, leaving his sanctum to pursue Strahd directly. His journals document decades of vampire hunting, his observations fill maps and notes, and his traps guard against intruders. The clay golem on the ground floor waits in dormant disguise, ready to animate if anyone speaks without the proper command word.

Ezmerelda d'Avenir, Van Richten's former student, currently resides in the tower's upper floors. She works on her weapons, reviews her mentor's notes, and prepares for her own hunt. Her presence makes the tower less empty but more dangerous—she's quick with a crossbow and slow to trust.

The tower's library contains invaluable knowledge about vampires and undead. The laboratory holds experiments and enhanced weapons. The observatory provides commanding views of the surrounding wilderness. And hidden in a secret compartment (if the Tarokka reading directed it here), the Tome of Strahd waits to be discovered—one of three artifacts essential for confronting the vampire lord.

Ravens circle overhead constantly. The Keepers of the Feather watch this location with interest, monitoring anyone who seeks the legendary vampire hunter. They know Van Richten's true importance in the struggle against Strahd.

The causeway stretches just above the water's surface, treacherous and narrow. Only those who know the path can cross safely. The tower maintains its isolation perfectly—a fortress of knowledge in hostile territory, waiting for those brave or foolish enough to breach its defenses.
