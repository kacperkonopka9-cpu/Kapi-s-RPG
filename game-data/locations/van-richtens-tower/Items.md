## Notes on Looting Ethics

### Van Richten's Property
- Tower contents belong to Van Richten, who is still alive
- Taking items without permission is theft from potential ally
- Ezmerelda (if present) will object to looting
- However, items are critical for fighting Strahd—Van Richten would likely approve if party proves worthy
- Best approach: Ask permission or leave note explaining what was taken and why

### Trap Consequences
- Triggering clay golem may destroy valuable items in combat
- Wagon explosion destroys all contents
- Silent approach or finding command word preserves maximum loot

### Keepers of the Feather
- Wereravens watching tower will report party's actions
- Respectful treatment of Van Richten's property earns Keepers' approval
- Looting like bandits damages reputation with anti-Strahd forces
