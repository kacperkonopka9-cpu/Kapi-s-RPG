# Van Richten's Tower - Description

## Overview

Van Richten's Tower is a five-story stone structure rising from a small island in Lake Baratok. Built centuries ago by an eccentric mage, it now serves as the secret refuge of Rudolph van Richten, Barovia's greatest vampire hunter. The tower is heavily trapped to deter intruders and contains valuable knowledge about vampires, undead, and Strahd himself. Van Richten abandoned it weeks ago to pursue Strahd directly, leaving behind his journals, equipment, and his former student Ezmerelda d'Avenir, who may or may not be present depending on her own hunt for Strahd.

## Initial Description

The tower rises from a rocky outcrop in the center of Lake Baratok, a cold mountain lake shrouded in perpetual mist. A narrow causeway of stones—barely visible above the water's surface—provides the only approach, treacherous and slippery. The tower itself is circular, built from gray stone that has weathered centuries of wind and rain. Five stories tall with a conical roof, it shows signs of recent habitation: smoke stains near upper windows, repaired mortar, and a reinforced door.

Near the shore, partially concealed by trees, sits a colorful Vistani wagon—brightly painted but rigged with deadly traps. This is Van Richten's mobile camp and laboratory, or possibly belongs to Ezmerelda if she's present. The wagon's presence suggests someone has been here recently, though the tower itself appears sealed and quiet.

Ravens circle overhead—Keepers of the Feather observers monitoring this location as they do all places of strategic importance. The tower has a reputation among locals as cursed or haunted, which serves Van Richten's purposes perfectly. Few dare approach.

## Return Description

The tower remains as you left it—sealed, trapped, and full of secrets. If you've befriended Ezmerelda, she may greet you from an upper window. If you've triggered Van Richten's traps and bypassed them, the approach is now safer but the hunter will know his sanctum has been compromised. The mist over Lake Baratok never fully lifts, and the tower's isolation remains absolute—perfect for someone hiding from Barovia's master.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Morning light does little to pierce the lake's mist. The causeway is slightly more visible, making approach marginally safer. This is when Ezmerelda (if present) tends to work on her weapons and review her notes, preparing for the next phase of her hunt. The tower's upper windows catch the dim sunlight, and chimney smoke may be visible if someone is home.

### Night

After dark, Lake Baratok becomes especially treacherous. The causeway disappears beneath black water, and only those who know the path can cross safely. If Ezmerelda is present, candlelight flickers in upper windows. This is when the tower feels most isolated—cut off from the world, a fortress of knowledge in hostile territory. Wolves howl from the surrounding forests, and occasionally, Strahd's spies (bats, wolves, or worse) circle the tower, watching for the vampire hunter's return.

## Points of Interest

### Ground Floor - Entry Hall and Workshop

The entry is protected by Van Richten's most elaborate trap—a clay golem disguised as furniture that activates if the wrong command word is spoken. The room contains a workbench with tools for crafting weapons and maintaining equipment, shelves of basic supplies, and a spiral staircase leading upward. Scratches on the floor suggest the golem has activated before.

### Second Floor - Library

Walls lined with books on undead, vampires, necromancy, and Barovian history. Van Richten's research collection spans decades of vampire hunting across multiple lands. A reading desk holds open books with notes in the margins—Van Richten's ongoing analysis of Strahd's patterns and weaknesses. This floor contains the most valuable knowledge in Barovia outside Castle Ravenloft itself.

### Third Floor - Laboratory

An arcane laboratory with preserved specimens, alchemical equipment, and experiments related to understanding undead physiology. Glass jars contain vampire fangs, werewolf claws, and other monster parts. A complex apparatus appears designed to test the effectiveness of holy water, garlic, and silvered weapons. Notes describe Van Richten's attempts to create enhanced weapons specifically for fighting Strahd.

### Fourth Floor - Living Quarters

Simple bedroom and living space where Van Richten (and now possibly Ezmerelda) reside. Personal belongings reveal the hunter's character: spare clothes, a locket with a faded portrait (his deceased family), prayer books to multiple gods, and weapons maintenance equipment. A small shrine to the Morninglord suggests Van Richten maintains faith despite witnessing horror for decades.

### Fifth Floor - Observatory and Study

The top floor features windows in all directions providing commanding views of Lake Baratok and surrounding forests. Van Richten used this as an observation post to track Strahd's movements. A telescope, maps of Barovia marked with sightings and encounters, and a journal documenting Strahd's recent activities. This is where Van Richten planned his final hunt—the culmination of his life's work.

### The Trapped Wagon

Van Richten's (or Ezmerelda's) wagon sits near the lakeshore. Brightly painted in Vistani style to provide cover identity, it's rigged with explosive traps. Inside (if traps are bypassed): more weapons, traveling supplies, disguises, false identification papers, and additional notes. The wagon serves as mobile command center for vampire hunting operations.

### Lake Baratok Shore

The lake itself is deep, cold, and home to strange fish that glow faintly in the depths. The shoreline is rocky and overgrown with twisted trees. This isolated location provides security but also makes escape difficult if Strahd discovers the tower. The Keepers of the Feather maintain watch from nearby trees, interested in anyone hunting their mutual enemy.

### The Causeway

A narrow path of stones just above water level, visible only to those who know where to look. Walking it requires careful balance (DC 10 Dexterity save, fall into cold water on failure). Van Richten knows the path by heart; others must discover it through observation or magical detection.
