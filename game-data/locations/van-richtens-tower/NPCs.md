# NPCs in Van Richten's Tower

## Rudolph van Richten (Absent - Hunting Strahd)

**NPC ID:** `rudolph_van_richten`
**Type:** Human Vampire Hunter (Level 9 Ranger/Fighter)
**Age:** 65
**Location:** Not present at tower - in Vallaki disguised as "Rictavio"
**Status:** Alive, using Hat of Disguise to hide from Strahd
**Full Profile:** `game-data/npcs/rudolph_van_richten.yaml` (Story 4-10)
**Disguise Profile:** `game-data/npcs/rictavio.yaml` (Story 4-10)

### Description

Van Richten is not at his tower when the party arrives—he's operating under the alias "Rictavio," a flamboyant carnival ringmaster staying at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki. He's a weathered man in his mid-60s with gray hair, piercing blue eyes that have seen too much horror, and the bearing of someone who has survived decades of hunting monsters. He's brilliant, cautious, paranoid, and ruthlessly pragmatic. His Hat of Disguise makes him appear 20 years younger with brown hair.

### AI Behavior Notes

- Will not be encountered here unless party has already met "Rictavio" in Vallaki
- His tower contains journals revealing his true identity and vampire hunting research
- Discovering his identity before he's ready creates complications
- If approached correctly, becomes powerful ally with vast knowledge of vampires
- Possesses Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (legendary anti-vampire artifact)
- Can be drawn as Tarokka ally for final battle against Strahd

## Ezmerelda d'Avenir (Roaming - May Be Present)

**NPC ID:** `ezmerelda_davenir`
**Type:** Human (Vistani Heritage) Monster Hunter (Level 8 Fighter/Ranger)
**Age:** 28
**Location:** ROAMING NPC - may appear at tower tracking Van Richten
**Status:** Alive, fierce, estranged from Van Richten
**Full Profile:** `game-data/npcs/ezmerelda_davenir.yaml` (Story 4-10)

### Description

Ezmerelda is a striking young woman with dark curly hair, olive skin, and fierce brown eyes. Her left leg is a silvered prosthetic with intricate clockwork—testament to her dangerous profession and a werewolf attack during Van Richten's training. She wears well-used studded leather armor adorned with vampire hunting trophies. She carries a rapier +1 and hand crossbow with practiced ease. Her Vistani heritage shows in her features, though she's estranged from her people for becoming a monster hunter.

She's bold, aggressive, and driven to prove herself as Van Richten's equal, not his student. Their relationship is complicated—he's her mentor and father figure, but pride prevents reconciliation despite both wanting it.

### Key Dialogue

- **If Found at Tower:** "Who are you and how did you bypass the traps? Actually, don't answer—if you're here to rob the place, you've made a fatal mistake."

- **About Van Richten:** "Van Richten? Old fool thinks he can hunt Strahd alone. We're stronger together, if I can convince him of that. Have you seen him?"

- **Offering Alliance:** "You're hunting Strahd? Good! I could use allies who won't run at the first sign of fangs. Let's kill a vampire lord."

### AI Behavior Notes

- ROAMING NPC - can appear anywhere tracking Van Richten or Strahd
- Recognizes Van Richten even through Hat of Disguise (knows him too well)
- Fierce combatant who leads with aggression
- Prosthetic leg can detach and be used as silvered club weapon
- Respects competence and bravery, dismisses cowards
- Can be drawn as Tarokka ally for final battle against Strahd
- If recruited, provides combat expertise and Van Richten connection
