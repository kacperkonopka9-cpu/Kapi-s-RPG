notes: "Van Richten's Tower is knowledge/ally hub rather than combat dungeon. Primary value is information (Van Richten journals, vampire hunting knowledge, possibly Tome of Strahd) and potential allies (Ezmerelda, Van Richten connection). Major trap challenge: clay golem (CR 9) activates if players speak without command word 'Khazan'—deadly for unprepared parties. Command word discoverable via DC 18 Investigation. Wagon has explosive trap (5d8 fire, DC 16 to disarm). Ezmerelda may be present—cautious but recruitable ally. Van Richten absent (disguised as Rictavio in Vallaki)—journal reveals his identity and location. Tome of Strahd may be here if Tarokka reading indicated (1 of 3 campaign artifacts). Tower contains Van Richten's Guide to Vampires (tactical advantage), enhanced anti-vampire weapons, and extensive research. Keepers of the Feather observe location—respectful behavior earns approval, looting damages reputation. Best approach: find command word before entering, don't loot without permission, ally with Ezmerelda, use information to find Van Richten in Vallaki. Tower serves as safe house if party earns Van Richten's trust. Connected to Vallaki (Rictavio), Keepers network, and broader vampire hunting storyline."
