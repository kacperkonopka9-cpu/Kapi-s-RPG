# NPCs in Market Square

## Captain Torrhen
- **Type:** Human Guard Captain
- **Age:** 38
- **Location:** Patrolling the Market Square or near the Guard Tower
- **Status:** Alive, Vigilant
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (Lawful, protective of citizens)
- **Quest Connection:** Law enforcement, security issues, potential quest giver for investigations

### Description
Captain Torrhen is a tall, broad-shouldered man with close-cropped dark hair graying at the temples and a neatly trimmed beard. He wears polished chainmail bearing the town's crest and carries a longsword at his hip with the ease of long practice. His steel-gray eyes constantly scan the square, missing nothing. Despite his imposing presence, he greets honest citizens with a respectful nod and a fair demeanor.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "Citizen. New to the square, I see. Welcome to Market Square. We keep good order here, so you're free to trade and travel as you wish. Just remember—we don't tolerate theft, violence, or fraud. Clear?"
- **About His Duties:** "I'm responsible for keeping the peace in the square and the surrounding district. Two dozen guards under my command patrol in shifts. Merchants pay taxes, and in return, we ensure their goods and their customers stay safe. It's a fair arrangement."
- **About Security:** "Crime is low here compared to other cities. We act quickly and fairly. Thieves who steal a loaf of bread get different treatment than those who rob merchants at knifepoint. Justice should fit the crime. But make no mistake—we catch most offenders eventually."
- **If Asked About Suspicious Activity:** "There's always something. Pickpockets work the crowds during busy hours. Occasionally, counterfeit coins turn up. And there have been reports of strange lights from the old library district to the east. No crimes reported there yet, but it bears watching."
- **Offering Help:** "If you witness a crime or need assistance, find me or any guard wearing the town crest. We're here to serve the people. Just don't waste our time with false reports—that's a punishable offense in itself."

### Stats

## Elara the Street Vendor
- **Type:** Human Commoner (Street Vendor)
- **Age:** 28
- **Location:** Stall near the central fountain (prime location)
- **Status:** Alive, Cheerful
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (Potential trading partner)
- **Quest Connection:** Local gossip, information about the square and town

### Description
Elara is a lively young woman with sun-bronzed skin, dark curly hair tied back with a colorful scarf, and an infectious smile that draws customers to her stall. She wears practical but bright clothing—a green vest over a white blouse, with a leather belt holding her coin purse. Her stall displays an array of fresh flowers, herbs, and small trinkets. Her voice carries across the square as she calls out to passersby, equal parts charm and salesmanship.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "Fresh flowers! Herbs for cooking and healing! Come see what catches your fancy, friend! Everything's quality, and the prices are honest—I promise!"
- **About Her Business:** "I've had this stall for three years now—earned it by being here before dawn every market day. The fountain location is prime real estate, you know. Good foot traffic, easy to spot, and people stop by the fountain anyway. I sell flowers mostly, but also herbs and little handmade charms. Not magical, mind you—just pretty."
- **About the Square:** "Market Square is the best place to learn what's happening in town. Everybody passes through here eventually. Merchants bring news from other cities, guards share what they hear on patrol, and customers love to gossip. If you want to know anything, just listen to the chatter—or ask me! I hear everything from this spot."
- **About Recent Events:** "Lately? Well, there's been talk about the old library. Some say scholars are researching something important. Others claim they've seen odd lights at night. I don't know the truth, but it's got people curious. Also, Captain Torrhen has been extra vigilant this week—more guards on patrol than usual. Maybe he's expecting trouble, or maybe it's just routine. Hard to say."
- **Selling:** "For you? Let me see... Fresh lavender, wonderful for sachets and sleep. Roses, perfect for gifting. Or perhaps this lucky charm? My grandmother made these—they're lovely even if they don't actually bring luck. What catches your eye?"

### Stats
- **AC:** 10 (no armor)
