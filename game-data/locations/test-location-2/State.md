Clear skies, pleasant temperature, light breeze carrying the mingled scents of fresh bread, flowers, and livestock from nearby farms.

## Location Status
- **Market Stalls:** Approximately 30 stalls operational. Merchants actively selling produce, textiles, tools, and sundries. Elara's flower stall near the fountain particularly busy.
- **Central Fountain:** Water flowing normally. Small crowd gathered around—some resting, others using it as a meeting point. Coins glint at the bottom (wishing tradition).
- **Guard Tower:** Fully staffed. Captain Torrhen visible on patrol. 2 guards at tower entrance, 3-4 more patrolling the square in pairs.
- **Permanent Shops:** All open for business during daytime hours. Foot traffic steady but not overwhelming. Shopkeepers visible in doorways.
