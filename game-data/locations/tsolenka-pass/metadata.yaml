lore_significance: |
  Tsolenka Pass represents the final natural barrier protecting the Amber Temple from casual discovery.
  The Roc may have been drawn here by the temple's magical emanations, or Strahd may have deliberately
  allowed it to nest here, creating an additional layer of defense. The frozen guards represent the last
  attempt by Barovian authorities to monitor and restrict access to the temple—an effort abandoned when
  Strahd withdrew support and let the garrison die of cold and starvation.

dm_notes: |
  The Roc encounter is DEADLY for parties below level 8. Consider telegraphing the danger (seeing the
  Roc from a distance, finding fresh kills) before forcing combat. The pass can be navigated via stealth
  (waiting for Roc to hunt elsewhere), magic (Invisibility, Fly), or social engineering (impossible—
  Roc is a beast with Int 3).

  The frozen guards provide lore and warnings about the Amber Temple's corruption. Their journal
  foreshadows the dark gifts system. If party gives them proper burial, grant blessing: advantage on
  first saving throw in Amber Temple.

  Weather can be used to increase tension or provide cover for sneaking past the Roc (storms reduce
  visibility both ways).
