# Tsolenka Pass - Description

## Overview

Tsolenka Pass is a treacherous mountain bridge spanning a thousand-foot chasm high in the Balinok Mountains. This ancient stone structure represents the only viable route to the Amber Temple, carved into the mountainside centuries ago by a forgotten civilization. The pass is perpetually shrouded in thick fog and buffeted by howling winds, making every step a test of courage and balance.

The bridge itself is a marvel of stonework, though time and harsh weather have taken their toll. Chunks of the balustrade have crumbled away, and ice coats much of the stone during all seasons. At the western end, a massive stone archway called Tsolenka Gate bears inscriptions warning travelers of the dangers ahead. The eastern approach features guard towers that once housed sentinels but now stand empty—or perhaps inhabited by things best left undiscovered.

## Initial Description

The mountain pass emerges from swirling mists as the party climbs higher into the Balinok range. Wind screams through the chasm, carrying snow and sleet even in summer months. The bridge stretches across the void, a ribbon of ancient stone seeming impossibly fragile against the mountain's scale.

Tsolenka Gate dominates the western approach—a towering archway carved with warnings in multiple dead languages. The inscriptions speak of guardians, forbidden knowledge, and the price of ambition. Ice crystals coat the stonework, making the carvings shimmer in what little light penetrates the perpetual storm clouds.

Two guard towers flank the eastern end of the bridge, their windows dark and empty. Snow has drifted against their doors. Claw marks score the stone walls—massive gouges that could only come from a creature of enormous size.

## Return Description

The pass seems even more hostile on subsequent visits. The wind blows harder, the ice thicker. If the Roc has been encountered before, massive feathers lie scattered across the bridge, some as long as a greatsword. The creature's nest atop the northern guard tower is more visible now—a chaotic mass of bones, treasure, and debris.

The archway's warnings seem more ominous with familiarity. The party now understands what "guardians" means in this context.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Dawn brings little warmth to Tsolenka Pass. The rising sun illuminates the chasm below, revealing its true horrifying depth—jagged rocks and frozen streams a thousand feet down. Visibility improves slightly, allowing the party to see the full scope of the bridge's deterioration. Several sections show significant damage, with gaps in the roadway bridged only by rotting wooden planks.

The morning light also reveals details of the guard towers: ancient Barovian military architecture, built to withstand siege, now crumbling from neglect and the Roc's habitation.

### Night

Nightfall transforms Tsolenka Pass into a nightmare. Visibility drops to near zero in the fog and darkness. The wind carries sounds—screams that might be the wind itself, or might be the last cries of travelers who fell into the chasm.

The Roc hunts more actively at night. Its shadow occasionally blocks out the stars as it circles overhead, and its piercing cry echoes off the mountain walls. The guard towers offer some shelter, but their interiors are pitch black and filled with the detritus of the Roc's meals—bones, rusted armor, and frozen corpses.

## Points of Interest

### Tsolenka Gate (Western Approach)

The massive stone archway stands thirty feet tall, carved from the living rock of the mountain. Its inscriptions warn in multiple languages:

*"Turn back, ye seekers of forbidden knowledge. The guardians do not sleep. The Amber corrupts. The price of wisdom is eternal damnation."*

DC 15 Intelligence (History) check reveals these are written in ancient Barovian, Draconic, and Celestial—suggesting the temple beyond was built to contain knowledge dangerous to mortals, immortals, and divine beings alike.

### The Bridge

The bridge spans 1,000 feet across a wind-scoured chasm. It's 15 feet wide with a 3-foot-high stone railing on either side—though significant sections of the railing have collapsed. The roadway shows cracks and ice, requiring DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks during high winds or combat.

Halfway across, a 10-foot section of the bridge has partially collapsed, leaving a treacherous gap bridged by ancient wooden planks that creak ominously underfoot.

### Northern Guard Tower

The Roc has claimed this tower as its nest. The interior is filled with bones (mostly goats and mountain animals, but some humanoid remains), treasure from plundered caravans, and the Roc's massive eggs (if encountered during breeding season).

A crude ladder leads to the tower's roof, where the nest proper sits. The Roc attacks anyone approaching its nest with murderous fury.

### Southern Guard Tower

This tower remains relatively intact and offers shelter from the wind. The interior contains the frozen remains of the last guards who manned this post—four Barovian soldiers who died at their post when the supply caravans stopped coming decades ago.

A thorough search (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation)) reveals a hidden cache: military rations (spoiled), winter gear (still usable), and a journal detailing the last weeks before the guards froze to death.

### The Chasm

Looking down reveals the true peril of this location. Jagged rocks line the chasm floor. Frozen streams wind between boulders. Scattered among the rocks are the remains of travelers who lost their footing—skeletons still wearing rusted armor, shattered wagons, and the occasional glint of treasure too dangerous to retrieve.

Falling from the bridge means certain death (10d6 bludgeoning damage minimum, plus environmental effects).
