# Tsolenka Pass - Current State

## First Visit

The party approaches Tsolenka Pass for the first time, unaware of the deadly guardian that claims this territory. The ancient bridge stretches across the chasm, appearing fragile against the mountain's scale. Wind howls through the pass, carrying snow and ice.

Tsolenka Gate's inscriptions remain undeciphered, their warnings unheeded. The guard towers stand silent—one housing a monster's nest, the other sheltering the frozen remains of soldiers long dead.

The Roc hunts these skies, and the party's arrival on the bridge will not go unnoticed.

## Environmental Conditions

- **Weather**: Mountain storms are common, bringing high winds, sleet, and reduced visibility
- **Temperature**: Below freezing at all times; winter gear essential
- **Visibility**: Varies from clear (rare) to heavily obscured (during storms)
- **Danger Level**: Extreme (CR 11 Roc, environmental hazards, bridge collapse risk)

## Current Threats

- **The Roc**: Active and territorial, attacks intruders on bridge
- **Bridge Integrity**: Ancient structure with damaged sections, risk of collapse during combat or storms
- **Mountain Storms**: Severe weather creates additional hazards
- **Extreme Cold**: Prolonged exposure without protection causes ongoing cold damage

## Available Shelter

- **Southern Guard Tower**: Intact, offers shelter from wind and weather, contains frozen guards' remains
- **Northern Guard Tower**: Roc's nest, extremely dangerous to approach while Roc lives

## Notes

The passage to the Amber Temple lies beyond this natural chokepoint. The Roc serves as the first guardian—whether placed here deliberately by Strahd or simply drawn by the magical emanations from the temple, the effect is the same. Few travelers make it past the bird alive.

Those who defeat or evade the Roc face an even greater challenge ahead: the Amber Temple itself, where forbidden knowledge and dark gifts await those foolish or desperate enough to seek them.
