  - Map of Barovia marking other dark power locations
  - Ancient letter from "the Dark Powers" acknowledging the coven's pact

## Quest Items

### Dream Pastries (Multiple Locations)
- **Critical Role:** These pastries are the reason for the entire operation. They're addictive and provide temporary escape from Barovia's horror. Party must decide what to do with remaining stock—destroy them (preventing further addiction but enraging addicts), distribute them freely (causing addiction), or secure them for evidence.

### Children's Belonging Evidence
- **Freek's Identification:** Toy horse that can be returned to his mother in Village of Barovia (though she may be too addicted to care)
- **Myrtle's Rag Doll:** Only possession linking her to her past (parents deceased, no home to return to)
- **Previous Victims:** Items that could identify other victims and allow their families to know their fate

### Windmill Deed
- **Significance:** Connects Old Bonegrinder to Death House and the Durst family's evil history. Proof that Gustav Durst sold property to night hags "for services rendered," suggesting the Dursts' cult may have worked with the coven. This document provides lore connections and possible leads to other locations.

### Morgantha's Map
- **Strategic Value:** If found, reveals locations of other evil sites in Barovia: Amber Temple (vaguely marked), Berez (marked as "sister's domain" - Baba Lysaga), and various haunted locations. Useful for campaign planning but also attracts danger if Strahd or other dark powers learn party has it.

## Notes

### Loot Ethics
- Much of the treasure here comes from murdered children and desperate addicts
- Party must decide whether to keep victim belongings or return them to families
- Dream pastries represent moral dilemma: destroy them vs. use them as trade goods
- Some items (soul bag, Infernal contracts) are inherently evil to possess

### Hag Heartstones
- If any hag escapes, her Heartstone must be found to prevent her return
- Heartstones allow night hags to travel Ethereally and haunt victims
- Destroying all three Heartstones permanently ends the coven threat
- If party only defeats one or two hags, survivors will eventually reform coven

### Connection to Broader Campaign
- Deed connects to Death House (Story 4-5 Task 1)
- Wereraven presence connects to Wizard of Wines (Story 4-5 Task 4)
- Customer lists reveal NPCs in Vallaki and Village of Barovia who are addicted
- Strahd's tolerance of the operation reveals his cruel pragmatism
