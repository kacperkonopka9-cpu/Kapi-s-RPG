# Old Bonegrinder - Current State

The windmill stands atop its barren hill, blades turning slowly in the perpetual wind. Smoke rises from the chimney—the ovens are active, baking today's batch of dream pastries. The sweet smell drifts across the hillside, masking the rot beneath.

Inside, the three night hags continue their grim business. Morgantha prepares for her next delivery round to the villages, her basket already filling with golden pastries. Bella operates the grinding stones, processing the bone meal that gives the pastries their "special ingredient." Offalia tends the ovens, humming disturbing nursery rhymes as she works.

On the third floor, two children huddle in their cages. Freek has been captive for a week, long enough to understand his fate but too weak to attempt escape. Myrtle arrived three days ago and hasn't spoken since. Both children are malnourished, terrified, and waiting for a rescue that may never come.

Ravens circle overhead continuously, watching with intelligence beyond that of normal birds. The Keepers of the Feather maintain their vigil, hoping someone capable will finally end the coven's reign of terror.

The windmill's mechanism turns, grinding stones rotate, and another day passes in the hags' profitable operation. Below, in the basement storage, barrels of sorted bones stand as testament to decades of victims. The dream pastry business continues, spreading addiction and misery throughout Barovia while providing the hags with an endless supply of ingredients.

Outside, the wereraven spies wait and watch, unable to act directly but ready to assist any who dare confront the monsters within.
