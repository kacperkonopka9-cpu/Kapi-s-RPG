# NPCs in Old Bonegrinder

## Morgantha

- **Type:** Night Hag (appears as elderly human peddler woman)
- **Age:** Unknown (appears 70s in human form, actually centuries old)
- **Location:** Traveling between villages during day, windmill at night
- **Status:** Alive, actively evil, coven leader
- **Relationship to Player:** Hostile (will feign friendliness if disguised)
- **Quest Connection:** "Destroy the Hag Coven," "Rescue the Children"

### Description

In her human guise, Morgantha appears as a cheerful elderly woman with a kind, grandmotherly face. She wears simple peasant clothing, an apron dusted with flour, and carries a large wicker basket filled with pastries. Her smile seems warm, her voice gentle and reassuring. This disguise is perfect, allowing her to travel Barovia's roads without suspicion.

In her true form, Morgantha is a nightmare made flesh. Her skin turns sickly gray-green, her teeth become iron fangs, her nails extend into black claws, and her eyes glow with malevolent hunger. She stands hunched but powerful, radiating an aura of wrongness that turns stomachs and breeds terror. Wiry gray hair falls in tangles around her monstrous face.

### Dialogue

- **Initial Greeting (Disguised):** "Oh, hello dearies! Would you like to buy some dream pastries? They're famous throughout Barovia—one bite and you'll forget all your troubles. Only one gold piece, such a small price for peace of mind!"

- **If Confronted:** "You don't understand! We provide a service! These wretched people would go mad without our pastries! What's a few sniveling brats compared to the comfort we bring? We're merchants, nothing more!"

- **True Nature Revealed:** "Foolish mortals! You think you can stop us? We've been grinding children into pastries for decades! Strahd himself tolerates our business! You'll end up in our ovens, just like all the others who've tried to stop us!"

- **Bargaining (If Losing):** "Wait! We can make a deal! Take the brats, leave us alone! We'll move our operation elsewhere! There must be something you want—power, knowledge, revenge? Hags know many secrets!"

## Bella Sunbane

- **Type:** Night Hag (appears as middle-aged human woman)
- **Age:** Unknown (appears 40s, actually centuries old)
- **Location:** Old Bonegrinder windmill
- **Status:** Alive, actively evil, coven member
- **Relationship to Player:** Hostile
- **Quest Connection:** "Destroy the Hag Coven"

### Description

In human form, Bella appears as a hard-faced woman with suspicious eyes and a cruel mouth. She's less convincing than Morgantha—something about her expression betrays the malice beneath. She wears a stained apron and keeps her hair tied back severely. Her hands are rough and scarred from years of grim work.

As a night hag, Bella is slightly larger and more muscular than Morgantha. Her gray-green skin is mottled with darker patches, and her claws are particularly long and sharp. She's more overtly aggressive than her mother, preferring violence to cunning.

### Dialogue

- **Initial Greeting:** "What do you want? This is private property. Mother's not here. Come back later—or better yet, don't come back at all."

- **If Party Enters Windmill:** "You've made a terrible mistake. Mother will be so pleased—fresh meat for the grinder! Sister, we have guests!"

- **During Combat:** "I'm going to tear you apart and use your bones for the next batch! Your screams will season the pastries nicely!"

### Stats

- **AC:** 17 (natural armor)
- **HP:** 112 (15d8+45)
- **Abilities:** STR 18, DEX 12, CON 16, INT 16, WIS 14, CHA 16

### AI Behavior Notes

- More aggressive and violent than Morgantha
- Stays at windmill to guard operation and process children
- Enjoys the cruel work more openly than mother
- In combat, focuses on frontline fighters with claws
- Uses Etherealness to escape if sisters are defeated
- Coordinates with Offalia for coven spells
- Will fight to death if mother orders it, otherwise flees if alone
- Guards the children on third floor—becomes enraged if they're freed

## Offalia Wormwiggle

- **Type:** Night Hag (appears as young human woman)
- **Age:** Unknown (appears 30s, actually centuries old)
- **Location:** Old Bonegrinder windmill
- **Age:** Unknown (appears 30s, actually centuries old)
- **Location:** Old Bonegrinder windmill
- **Status:** Alive, actively evil, coven member
- **Relationship to Player:** Hostile
- **Quest Connection:** "Destroy the Hag Coven"

### Description

In human disguise, Offalia appears as an attractive but unsettling woman with a too-wide smile and eyes that don't blink enough. She maintains the youngest-looking disguise, using beauty to disarm victims. Her manner is sing-song and childlike, which makes her true nature even more disturbing.

As a night hag, Offalia is the smallest of the three but perhaps the most disturbing. Her movements are jerky and insect-like, and she makes chittering sounds when excited. Her claws are hooked like a mantis's, and her teeth are needle-sharp rather than fanged.

### Dialogue

- **Initial Greeting:** "Oh, visitors! How wonderful! Are you here to play? Or to buy pastries? Or maybe... to become pastries? Hehehehe!"

- **Referring to Children:** "The little ones upstairs are being so quiet today. Good little ingredients. Not like the last batch—they screamed and screamed until we had to shut them up!"

- **During Combat:** "This is fun! More fun than grinding bones! Let's play the screaming game! Hehehehe!"

### Stats

- **AC:** 17 (natural armor)
- **HP:** 112 (15d8+45)
- **Abilities:** STR 18, DEX 12, CON 16, INT 16, WIS 14, CHA 16

### AI Behavior Notes

- Most unhinged and unpredictable of the three
- Takes active pleasure in cruelty to children
- Uses disturbing childlike manner even in true form
- In combat, targets spellcasters and support characters
- Giggles and makes unsettling comments throughout fights
- Will use Nightmare Haunting on party members who escape
- If captured alone, may babble secrets and disturbing information
- Least likely to flee—enjoys combat and carnage too much

## Freek (Captive Child)

- **Type:** Human child
- **Age:** 7 years old
- **Location:** Third floor cage, Old Bonegrinder
- **Status:** Alive, terrified, malnourished
- **Relationship to Player:** Desperate for rescue
- **Quest Connection:** "Rescue the Children"

### Description

Freek is a small boy with hollow cheeks and haunted eyes. His clothes are torn and filthy, and he huddles in the corner of his cage, arms wrapped around his knees. He's been captive for a week—long enough to understand his fate but not yet processed. He rarely speaks, communicating mostly through terrified whimpers.

### Dialogue

- **Initial Contact:** [Whimpers] "Please... please help us... they're going to grind us up... I want to go home..."

- **If Freed:** "Thank you! Thank you! We have to run! They'll come back! They always come back!"

- **About His Capture:** "A nice old lady gave Mother a pastry. Mother ate it and smiled and forgot everything. Then Mother bought more and more. When Mother couldn't pay, the old lady said she'd take me instead. Mother was too lost in dreams to care..."

### Stats

- **AC:** 10
- **HP:** 3 (1d8-1)
- **Abilities:** STR 6, DEX 10, CON 8, INT 10, WIS 8, CHA 12

### AI Behavior Notes

## Myrtle (Captive Child)

- **Type:** Human child
- **Age:** 5 years old
- **Location:** Third floor cage, Old Bonegrinder
- **Status:** Alive, terrified, malnourished
- **Relationship to Player:** Too traumatized to respond initially
- **Quest Connection:** "Rescue the Children"

### Description

Myrtle is even younger than Freek, a tiny girl with tangled blonde hair and wide, shell-shocked eyes. She hasn't spoken since being caged a few days ago. She clutches a filthy rag doll—the only possession the hags haven't taken. She rocks back and forth constantly, humming a broken lullaby.

### Dialogue

- **Initial Contact:** [Silent, rocking, humming]

- **If Gently Approached:** [Whispers] "Are you taking me to Mama?"

- **After Rescue:** [Gradually begins to talk, but trauma will last] "The gray ladies said I was special. They said I'd help make people happy. But they lied. They hurt the boy before Freek. I heard him screaming..."

### Stats

- **AC:** 10
- **HP:** 2 (1d8-2)
- **Abilities:** STR 4, DEX 10, CON 6, INT 10, WIS 8, CHA 14

### AI Behavior Notes

- Deeply traumatized, requires patient, gentle handling
- Will cling to any protector once trust is established
- Cannot provide useful information—too young and traumatized
- Slows party escape due to inability to move quickly
- Represents the innocent victims and stakes of stopping the hags
- Has no family—parents were killed by wolves, making her easy target

## Wereraven Spy (Keepers of the Feather)

- **Type:** Wereraven in raven form
- **Age:** Unknown
- **Location:** Trees and roof near Old Bonegrinder
- **Status:** Alive, observing
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral to friendly (if party opposes hags)
- **Quest Connection:** "Destroy the Hag Coven"

### Description

One or more ravens constantly circle Old Bonegrinder, watching with unusual intelligence. These are members of the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens who oppose evil in Barovia. They've been monitoring the hag coven but lack the strength to confront the hags directly. They're waiting for someone capable of stopping the coven.

### Dialogue

- **If Party Attacks Hags:** [Raven caws encouragingly, may dive-bomb hags to provide distraction]

- **If Party Succeeds:** [Raven lands nearby, morphs into human form] "Well done. The Keepers of the Feather have watched these monsters for too long. You've done Barovia a service. The Martikov family will remember this."

### AI Behavior Notes

- Observes but doesn't initially intervene
- May provide tactical advantage (distraction, warning) if party fights hags
- Can reveal wereraven form and provide information after hag threat is eliminated
- Connection to Wizard of Wines and broader Keepers of the Feather storyline
- Will report party's actions (good or bad) to Martikov family
