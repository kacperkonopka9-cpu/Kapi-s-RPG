# Old Bonegrinder - Description

## Overview

Old Bonegrinder is a decrepit windmill perched atop a rocky hill, visible for miles across the Barovian landscape. Once a grain mill serving local farmers, it now serves a darker purpose as the lair of three night hags who operate under the guise of kindly pastry-makers. The hags—Morgantha and her daughters Bella and Offalia—grind the bones of kidnapped children to create addictive dream pastries that they sell throughout Barovia, offering fleeting escape from the land's misery at a terrible price.

## Initial Description

The windmill rises from a barren hilltop, its silhouette stark against the gray sky. The wooden structure lists slightly to one side, weathered by centuries of wind and rain. Four massive blades, their canvas torn and flapping, turn slowly with tortured creaks that echo across the valley. Ravens circle overhead in unusual numbers, their caws carrying warnings to those who understand.

A worn path winds up the hill between dead grass and scattered stones. The smell reaches you before you summit—something sweet and enticing, like fresh baking, underlaid with a rot that catches in the throat. Smoke rises from the windmill's chimney, and through the windows on the upper floors, shadows move with jerky, unnatural motions.

The building stands three stories tall with a cone-shaped roof. The ground floor shows signs of recent activity: a door reinforced with iron bands, fresh footprints in the dirt, and a small lean-to shelter where sacks of "flour" are stacked. But the sacks move slightly, as if breathing, and from within the windmill comes occasional thumping and muffled sounds that might be machinery—or might be something else entirely.

Wereraven spies frequently watch from nearby trees, part of the Keepers of the Feather's ongoing surveillance of the hag coven's evil activities.

## Return Description

The windmill's blades continue their tortured rotation, creaking with each turn. The sweet-rotten smell persists, stronger now that you know its source. The ravens seem more agitated, their circling tighter and their cries more urgent. If you've confronted the hags before, signs of that encounter remain—broken windows, scorched walls, or an ominous silence that suggests the coven is preparing for your return. The building itself seems to watch with malevolent awareness, knowing you've discovered its terrible secret.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Dawn light does nothing to make Old Bonegrinder less sinister. Morning mist clings to the hillside, and the windmill emerges from fog like a skeletal hand reaching for the sky. This is when Morgantha often departs on her rounds, traveling to villages with her basket of pastries. The daughters remain inside, continuing their grim work. Smoke rises steadily from the chimney as the ovens are stoked for the day's baking. The sounds of grinding echo louder in the still morning air—stone against stone, and occasionally something that sounds disturbingly like bone.

### Night

After dark, Old Bonegrinder reveals its true nature. The hags drop their human disguises, becoming the monstrous creatures they truly are. Eerie lights flicker in the upper windows as the coven performs dark rituals. The windmill's shadow stretches impossibly long across the hillside. Strange chanting in the hags' twisted language drifts on the wind, along with the cries of their captive children. The ravens depart at nightfall, unable to bear witness to the horrors within. This is the worst time to approach, for the hags are at their most powerful in darkness, and their magics run deep.

## Points of Interest

### Ground Floor - Millstone Room

The main floor houses the windmill's grinding stones—massive circular stones connected to the windmill's mechanism above. Between the stones, bone fragments and pulverized remains mix with actual flour to create the pastry mixture. The room reeks of death beneath the sweet smell of baking. A trapdoor in the floor leads to the storage basement. A narrow staircase winds upward to the second floor.

**Details**: Grinding stones show signs of recent use. Blood stains are poorly cleaned from the floor. Sacks labeled "flour" contain suspicious powdery mixtures. The windmill mechanism dominates the space, its gears and chains rattling as the blades turn outside.

### Second Floor - Kitchen and Living Quarters

The second floor serves as the hags' kitchen and common area. A large brick oven dominates one wall, radiating heat and the smell of baking pastries. Shelves hold jars of ingredients—most mundane, some horrifying (pickled organs, bottled tears, dried eyes). A table is set for three, with plates made from skulls. The hags' personal belongings clutter the space: spell components, fetishes made from hair and bone, and journals documenting their victims.

**Details**: Pastries cool on racks, golden and delicious-looking despite their vile ingredients. A locked cabinet contains the hags' most precious components. Doors lead to small sleeping alcoves where the hags rest. Windows offer views of the surrounding countryside.

### Third Floor - Children's Prison

The top floor has been converted into a holding area for kidnapped children. Crude cages made from salvaged wood and iron bars line the walls. Currently, two children are imprisoned here: Freek and Myrtle, both in various stages of despair. The room is cold, dark, and reeks of fear and waste. Small toys and tattered blankets provide meager comfort. The children cry softly, having learned that loud screaming only brings the hags' wrath.

**Details**: Cages are locked but could be forced open (DC 15 Strength or DC 12 with thieves' tools). Children are malnourished and terrified. Dried blood stains mark where previous victims were kept. A small window offers the only light, but it's too high for children to reach and too small for escape.

### Roof and Windmill Mechanism

A ladder provides access to the roof and windmill mechanism. The massive blades connect to a central axle that drives the grinding stones below through a series of gears and chains. The roof offers commanding views of the surrounding area—one can see Vallaki to the east and the Wizard of Wines to the south on clear days. This is where wereravens perch to spy on the hags, and where the hags themselves sometimes stand to watch for approaching threats.

**Details**: Mechanism is functional but poorly maintained. Sabotaging it could shut down the mill (but also alert hags). Roof access allows entry through upper windows if ground floor is too dangerous.

### Basement Storage

Beneath the ground floor, accessible via trapdoor, lies a root cellar converted to storage. Here the hags keep sacks of actual flour, barrels of water, preserved foods, and most disturbingly, the bones of children who've already been processed. Loose bones are sorted by type—skulls in one barrel, long bones in another, small bones in sacks. The basement also contains the deed to the windmill, originally owned by the Durst family (connection to Death House).

**Details**: Dark and damp, illuminated only by what light filters through floor cracks. Inventory of horror that reveals the full extent of the hags' operation. Contains evidence (bones, personal effects) of dozens of victims over many years.

### Surrounding Hillside

The hill itself is barren and rocky, with dead grass and gnarled trees. A few stunted bushes cling to life. The path up is the easiest approach, but there are steeper routes that provide cover. Scattered stones could provide cover in combat. The hilltop offers no escape routes except back down—the windmill is isolated and exposed, which suits the hags' purposes perfectly.
