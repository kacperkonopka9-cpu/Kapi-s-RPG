notes: "Old Bonegrinder is major mid-level combat encounter featuring night hag coven (deadly for level 4-6 parties). Three CR 5 creatures plus coven magic makes this extremely dangerous if all hags present. Strategic timing (wait for Morgantha to leave) reduces difficulty. Moral imperative: two children are captive and will be killed if party delays too long. Dream pastry operation creates addiction crisis throughout Barovia, affecting multiple settlements. Windmill deed connects to Death House, revealing Durst family sold property to hags 15 years ago. Wereraven surveillance ties to Keepers of the Feather faction and Wizard of Wines location. Defeating coven earns Keepers' alliance and significant reputation boost. Failure or delay results in more child deaths and spreading addiction. Hags use Etherealness to escape if losing—destroying Heartstones prevents this. Location has complex loot including evil items (soul bag, Infernal contracts) that test party morality. Recommended approach: scout location, wait for Morgantha to depart, attack when only 2 hags present, free children, destroy coven, secure Heartstones to prevent returns."
