# Tser Pool Encampment - Description

## Overview

The Tser Pool Encampment is a colorful Vistani camp nestled beside a mountain lake at the crossroads of Barovian travel routes. Painted wagons circle a central bonfire, fortune-teller tents flutter with mystic symbols, and the air fills with music, laughter, and the aromatic scent of exotic cooking. This is the domain of Madam Eva, the ancient seer whose Tarokka readings reveal destinies and unlock the path to confronting Strahd.

## Initial Description

The encampment sprawls along the shore of the Tser Pool, a cold mountain lake reflecting the gray sky above. A dozen brightly painted vardos (wagons) form a defensive circle around a large central bonfire that burns day and night. Colorful tents cluster between the wagons—some for sleeping, others for fortune-telling or trading.

Vistani move about the camp with casual confidence. Men sharpen weapons while smoking pipes, women tend cookfires and mend clothing, children run laughing between wagons despite the gloom of Barovia. Music drifts from somewhere within the circle—a violin playing a haunting melody.

At the camp's heart sits Madam Eva's tent, larger and more ornate than the others. Purple silk adorned with golden moons and stars billows in the breeze. Two Vistani guards stand watch at its entrance, though they seem more ceremonial than threatening.

The Tser Pool itself stretches dark and still beyond the camp. Mountains rise on all sides, their peaks lost in perpetual mist. A stone bridge crosses the Tser River where it flows from the pool, continuing the Old Svalich Road toward Vallaki.

## Return Description

The encampment continues its timeless rhythm. The bonfire crackles, sending sparks into the gray sky. Vistani nod in recognition as you approach, some offering knowing smiles as if they expected your return. Madam Eva's tent remains at the camp's center, its silk walls rippling with secrets yet to be revealed. The atmosphere shifts based on what she has foreseen—welcoming if destinies align, wary if darker paths have been glimpsed.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Morning mist rises from the Tser Pool, wreathing the camp in ethereal fog. Vistani emerge from tents and wagons, stretching and greeting the day with practiced cheer. Cookfires are rekindled, filling the air with the smell of strong coffee and frying bread. Children fetch water from the pool while adults tend to horses and repair equipment. Madam Eva's tent remains closed until mid-morning—even seers need their rest.

### Night

After nightfall, the encampment transforms into a place of magic and revelry. The bonfire roars higher, casting dancing shadows on wagon walls. Vistani gather in circles—some telling stories, others singing, a few dancing to violin and tambourine music. Wine flows freely, and strangers are welcomed with suspicious generosity. This is when Madam Eva performs her most powerful readings, when the veil between worlds grows thin and the Tarokka cards speak their truest prophecies. Occasionally, a figure in a dark cloak watches from beyond the firelight—Strahd sometimes visits, and the Vistani do not bar his way.

## Points of Interest

### Madam Eva's Tent
The fortune-teller's tent dominates the camp's center. Inside, cushions surround a low table where the ancient Vistana performs her legendary Tarokka readings. The air smells of incense and herbs. Countless symbols and mystical objects clutter every surface—bones, crystals, dried herbs, and strange artifacts from distant lands.

### Central Bonfire
The camp's heart and gathering place. Logs arranged around the fire serve as benches. This is where Vistani share meals, tell stories, trade news, and welcome guests. At night, performers entertain here while wine passes freely.

### Trading Wagons
Several wagons serve as mobile shops, their sides opening to reveal goods for trade: weapons, traveling supplies, exotic spices, jewelry, and mysterious charms. Vistani merchants drive hard bargains but deal honestly with those who show respect.

### Horse Corral
North of the camp, Vistani horses graze in a makeshift corral. These are fine animals, better cared for than most beasts in Barovia. The Vistani are skilled horse traders and breeders.

### The Tser Pool Shore
The dark lake stretches to the south, its waters too cold and deep for swimming. Some say the pool is bottomless, that things lurk beneath its surface. The Vistani sometimes fish here but never at night.

### Stone Bridge
East of the camp, the stone bridge crosses the Tser River, continuing the road toward Vallaki. From here, travelers can see the Tser Falls upstream, where water cascades down the mountainside.
