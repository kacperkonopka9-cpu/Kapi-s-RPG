## Hidden Items (Requires Investigation)

### Around Camp
- **Lost Pouch:** DC 12 Investigation in north camp area. Contains 15 gp, 7 sp, 22 cp, and a silver ring worth 10 gp. Belongs to careless Vistani who lost it gambling—returning it earns gratitude.

- **Forgotten Weapon Cache:** DC 15 Investigation near horse corral. Small cache buried by paranoid guard years ago: 2 silvered daggers, 1 hand crossbow with 10 bolts. If found and reported to Luvash, he allows party to keep one item and splits the rest with camp.

### Madam Eva's Tent (Requires Permission or Stealth)
- **Ancient Tome:** DC 18 Investigation in Madam Eva's private effects. "Tome of Vistani Lore" containing history of the Vistani, their customs, and cryptic references to the Dark Powers. Madam Eva will catch anyone stealing this and either curse them or demand a quest as penance.

- **Enchanted Tarokka Card:** DC 20 Investigation in hidden drawer. Single card from an ancient deck, "The Artifact." Can be used once to ask a yes/no question and receive a true answer. If stolen, brings misfortune (disadvantage on all ability checks until returned or atoned for).

### Tser Pool Shore
- **Drowned Treasure:** DC 15 Investigation along the pool's shore. Remains of old campsite that slid into the lake years ago. Can recover: waterlogged backpack containing 25 gp worth of trade goods (jewelry, pelts), a rusty longsword (can be restored), and a journal describing the traveler's final days (contains hints about Vallaki).

## Special Quest Items

### Arabelle's Doll (If Quest Active)
- **Description:** Small cloth doll found if searching for missing Arabelle. Located at Tser Pool shore (DC 12 Investigation) or where she was last seen. Proves she was at the pool and suggests she either fell in or was taken. Returning this to Luvash before finding Arabelle causes him great distress but confirms the quest's urgency.

### Tarokka Prophecy Results (After Reading)
- **Prophecy Card Set:** After receiving Tarokka reading, party gains metaphysical "knowledge" of three locations marked by fate: one for Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, one for Sun Sword, one for Strahd's final confrontation location. Also reveals one ally who will aid them. These aren't physical items but campaign-critical information.

## Notes

### Trading with Vistani
- Vistani merchants are shrewd but honest
- Prices are standard D&D 5e values, no markup for being in Barovia
- Will not accept stolen goods or items taken from Vistani
- Building trust with camp (completing quests, showing respect) may unlock special items or discounts

### Madam Eva's Services
- First Tarokka reading is free and quest-critical (reveals campaign locations)
- Subsequent readings cost 10 gp and provide personal guidance
- She will not read for those who show disrespect or bad faith
- Her readings are always true but often cryptic until events unfold

### Restricted Items
- Vistani will not sell poisoned weapons or overtly evil items
- Rare magic items may become available after earning significant trust
- Weapons effective against Strahd (holy weapons, special materials) are not in general inventory but might be "found" via hidden items if party proves worthy
