notes: "Tser Pool Encampment is campaign-critical location where Madam Eva performs the Tarokka reading that reveals locations of key items and Strahd's confrontation location. The reading determines campaign structure and must occur early. Arabelle quest creates time pressure and potential for Vistani alliance. Arrigal provides ongoing intrigue as Strahd's spy within seemingly neutral ground. Camp serves as safe haven and trading post throughout campaign. Strahd respects Vistani neutrality—will visit but not attack camp. Location is accessible to all character levels but most relevant early campaign."
