# Tser Pool Encampment - Current State

The Vistani encampment sits peacefully beside the mountain lake. Colorful wagons circle the eternal bonfire, and the sounds of life—laughter, music, conversation—drift through the camp. This place exists outside Barovia's oppression, a pocket of vitality maintained by the mysterious Vistani people.

Madam Eva's tent stands at the camp's heart, its purple silk walls hiding secrets and prophecies. The ancient seer awaits within, knowing that fate will soon bring travelers to her door. The Tarokka cards are ready.

Luvash, the camp leader, maintains watchful oversight of his people. His daughter Arabelle plays near the wagons, unaware of the dangers that lurk beyond the firelight. The camp's guards patrol with casual alertness—threats are rare here, but never dismissed.

The Tser Pool stretches dark and cold to the south, its depths unknowable. Mountains rise on all sides, trapping Barovia in their embrace. The stone bridge crosses the Tser River eastward, the road continuing toward distant Vallaki.

The camp welcomes travelers with cautious hospitality. The Vistani know everyone eventually comes seeking Madam Eva's wisdom. The cards always know when visitors are coming.
