## Mira the Traveling Merchant
- **Type:** Half-Elf Trader
- **Age:** 32
- **Location:** Corner table near the fireplace, often reviewing ledgers
- **Status:** Alive, Cautiously Friendly
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (Potential trading partner)
- **Quest Connection:** Can provide information about Market Square and trade goods

### Description
Mira is a lean, sharp-featured half-elf with keen amber eyes and auburn hair tied back in a practical braid. She wears travel-worn but well-made clothing—leather vest over a linen shirt, sturdy boots, and a belt with several pouches. Her fingers are ink-stained from maintaining her ledgers, and she carries herself with the confidence of someone accustomed to negotiating deals and navigating unfamiliar places.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "Another traveler at the crossroads. Seems we're all drawn to the same warm fire on a cold night. Are you passing through, or do you have business in town?"
- **About Her Trade:** "I deal in textiles and spices, mostly. I buy from the countryside and sell in the city markets. It's good business if you know the routes and can stomach the risks. Bandits, weather, fickle customers—it's all part of the trade."
- **About Market Square:** "I'm heading to Market Square tomorrow at first light. The morning is the best time to get a good stall location. If you're looking to buy or sell anything, that's the place. Just be prepared to haggle—merchants there don't give anything away."
- **If Asked for Advice:** "If you're new to town, stick to the main roads and keep your valuables out of sight. The Market Square is generally safe during the day, but the back alleys can be... less welcoming. And if you need books or research, there's an old library to the east. Strange place, but the scholars know their business."

### Stats
- **AC:** 12 (leather vest)

- Prefers to avoid conflict but can defend herself if necessary
