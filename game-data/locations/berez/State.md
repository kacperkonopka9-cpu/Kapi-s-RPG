# Berez - Current State

## First Approach

The cursed swamp of Berez stretches before the party—a testament to Strahd's wrath and Baba Lysaga's devotion. The third winery gem lies within the animated hut, guarded by one of Barovia's most powerful servants of the vampire lord.

This is end-game content. Baba Lysaga is CR 11, nearly as powerful as Strahd himself. Her hut adds another threat. Scarecrows swarm the swamp. Only well-prepared, high-level parties should attempt this location.

But the reward is worth it: The final winery gem completes the Martikovs' quest, earning eternal alliance and restoring hope to Barovia.

## Strategic Objective

Defeat Baba Lysaga, destroy or disable her hut, and recover the third winery gem.

## Current Threats

- Baba Lysaga (CR 11 night hag, deadly spellcaster)
- Creeping Hut (CR 4 animated construct)
- 12+ scarecrows (CR 1 each, swarm tactics)
- Swamp hazards (difficult terrain, insects, disease)

## Notes

Berez is phase 3 finale of the winery quest chain. Success here completes one of the campaign's major quest arcs and provides significant ally in the Martikovs. Failure means the third gem remains lost and winery cannot reach full production.

Parties should be level 9-11 minimum. CR 11 boss is no joke.
