lore_significance: |
  Berez was destroyed by Strahd when its burgomaster hid Marina (Tatyana lookalike) from him. The vampire drowned the entire village and cursed the land to become pestilent swamp. Baba Lysaga, believing herself Strahd's mother, claimed the ruins and uses the winery gem to power her magic.

dm_notes: |
  Berez is end-game content. CR 11 Baba Lysaga is one of the toughest encounters outside Strahd himself. The hut adds complexity. Scarecrows create swarm pressure. This completes the winery quest arc—3 phases over multiple locations. Victory is massively rewarding (gem, treasure, eternal Martikov alliance).
