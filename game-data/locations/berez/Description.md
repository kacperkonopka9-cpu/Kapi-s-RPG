# Berez - Description

## Overview

Berez is a cursed swamp village, destroyed by Strahd centuries ago and now home to Baba Lysaga—an ancient hag and Strahd's most devoted servant. The village ruins lie submerged in fetid swamp water, dominated by Marina's Monument (a massive stone statue) and Baba Lysaga's walking hut. The hag guards the third winery magic gem, using its power to fuel her dark magic.

Berez represents Strahd's wrath: He destroyed this village when its burgomaster defied him by hiding a woman named Marina (Tatyana reincarnation). The entire population was drowned, and the land cursed to become pestilent swamp.

## Initial Description

The swamp reeks of rot and stagnation. Ruined buildings emerge from murky water, their walls covered in moss and decay. Scarecrows stand in the muck—not harvest decorations, but animated guardians with pumpkin heads and wickedly sharp claws. Swarms of insects fill the air.

At the swamp's center rises Marina's Monument—a 35-foot stone statue of a beautiful woman, arms raised in futile supplication. Baba Lysaga's hut squats nearby, a grotesque structure on giant chicken legs, capable of walking and attacking.

## Return Description

The hag knows when intruders return. Scarecrows reposition to ambush. The hut relocates to more defensible ground. If Baba Lysaga was injured before, she's prepared counter-tactics and additional defenses.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning light reveals the full horror of Berez—rotting buildings, stagnant water, and dozens of scarecrow guardians. Baba Lysaga often flies on her giant skull outside the hut during daylight, surveying her domain.

### Night
At night, the hag performs dark rituals inside her hut. The swamp comes alive with will-o'-wisps and ghostly apparitions of drowned villagers. The monument seems to weep. This is when Baba Lysaga is most dangerous but also most distracted by rituals.

## Points of Interest

### Marina's Monument
A 35-foot stone statue depicts Marina, the Tatyana lookalike whose presence here caused Berez's destruction. The statue's eyes seem to follow movement. DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) reveals a hollow interior containing treasures Baba Lysaga hoards.

### Baba Lysaga's Hut
A grotesque structure on giant chicken legs. The hut can walk (30 ft. speed), attack with its legs (CR 4 creature), and contains Baba Lysaga's inner sanctum. The third winery gem is inside, powering the hut's animation.

### Ruined Cottages
Swamp-submerged buildings, former homes now inhabited by swarms and giant spiders. Some contain minor treasure or lore about Berez's destruction.

### Burgomaster's Mansion
The largest ruin, where Berez's burgomaster lived. His journal (if found, DC 16 Investigation) describes hiding Marina from Strahd and the terrible consequences.

## Environmental Hazards

- Difficult terrain (swamp water, mud)
- Insect swarms (distraction, disease risk)
- Scarecrow ambushes (CR 1 each, 12+ scarecrows)
- Baba Lysaga (CR 11 boss)
- Walking hut (CR 4 construct)
