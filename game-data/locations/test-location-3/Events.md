# Events in Ancient Library

## Scheduled Events

### Evening Closing
- **Trigger:** Daily at 20:00 (8 PM)
- **Type:** Administrative Event
- **Effect:** Master Aldwyn announces closing time and begins ushering patrons out. Scholars reluctantly gather their materials. Lamps are extinguished except for a few near the circulation desk. Main doors are locked. Only those with special late-night research permission may remain. Atmosphere shifts from active scholarship to quiet, almost secretive study.
- **Consequence:** Library becomes inaccessible until morning (07:00 / 7 AM) unless player has special permission or finds another way in. Late-night access may reveal additional mysteries or events.

## Conditional Events

### Request for Research Assistance
- **Trigger:** Player asks Master Aldwyn or Lyssa for help finding specific information
- **Type:** Social/Information Event
- **Effect:** The NPC assists player in locating relevant texts, explains library cataloging system, or shares specialized knowledge. May lead to learning new information, discovering quest hooks, or gaining access to normally restricted materials. For complex or dangerous research topics, Master Aldwyn may require proof of legitimate need or scholarly credentials.
- **Consequence:** Information gained. Potential quest hooks revealed. Relationship with library staff improves. May unlock access to second floor or (with exceptional need) third floor.

### Mysterious Lights Investigation
- **Trigger:** Player investigates the third floor without permission at night, or asks directly about the strange lights
- **Type:** Mystery/Potential Conflict Event
- **Effect:** If player sneaks to third floor after hours, they discover evidence of advanced magical research being conducted—arcane circles, glowing runes, strange equipment. May encounter Master Aldwyn or an unknown researcher. If caught, Master Aldwyn demands explanation. If player has legitimate scholarly reason, he may reluctantly explain the lights are from sanctioned research. If player lacks justification, they're banned temporarily from the library.
- **Consequence:** Mystery partially revealed or deepened. Possible temporary ban if caught trespassing. Potential quest hook for magical research storyline. May gain or lose Master Aldwyn's trust.

## Recurring Events
- **Morning Opening:** Every day at 07:00 (7 AM), Master Aldwyn unlocks the main doors and prepares the reading room. Early scholars arrive and settle into their research. Oil lamps are lit if needed. Atmosphere: quiet awakening, scholarly routine beginning.
- **Scholar Study Sessions:** Throughout the day (9 AM - 5 PM), 3-8 scholars occupy study tables, reading and taking notes. Whispered conversations occasionally break the silence. Quills scratch on parchment. Pages turn. Atmosphere: focused intellectual work, mutual respect for quiet.
- **Late Night Research (Restricted):** Occasionally after closing, faint lights appear in third floor windows. Master Aldwyn claims this is sanctioned late-night study, though he doesn't elaborate on who or what is being researched. Atmosphere: mysterious, secretive, potentially significant.
