# NPCs in Ancient Library

## Master Aldwyn (The Librarian)
- **Type:** Human Scholar (Elderly Librarian)
- **Age:** 67
- **Location:** Circulation desk on the first floor, occasionally wandering the stacks
- **Status:** Alive, Alert despite age
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (Helpful to serious scholars, dismissive of time-wasters)
- **Quest Connection:** Research assistance, information about rare books, potential quest giver for lost tomes

### Description
Master Aldwyn is a thin, elderly man with wispy white hair, spectacles perched on his nose, and ink-stained fingers from decades of cataloging and note-taking. He wears simple scholarly robes in deep blue, marked with the library's insignia—an open book beneath a candle. Despite his age, his blue-gray eyes are sharp and miss nothing. He moves through the library with quiet authority, knowing the location of every volume without consulting records.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** "Welcome to the Ancient Library. Please speak quietly—others are studying. How may I assist your research today? We maintain an extensive collection, though access to certain sections requires... appropriate credentials."
- **About the Library:** "This library has stood for over three hundred years. The original structure was built by the Scholars' Guild when this was merely a village. We've expanded twice since then. Currently, we house approximately fourteen thousand volumes, scrolls, and manuscripts covering history, natural philosophy, magical theory, and more esoteric subjects."
- **About Access:** "The first floor is open to all who respect the rules: silence, careful handling of materials, and no removal of books without proper checkout. The second floor requires a modest research fee or guild membership. The third floor... well, that requires special permission and a compelling reason. Dangerous knowledge must be carefully guarded."
- **If Asked About Research:** "What subject interests you? History? Magic? Geography? I can direct you to the appropriate section. If you seek something specific, I may need time to locate it—our cataloging system is thorough but complex."
- **About Strange Lights:** *Adjusts spectacles* "Ah, you've heard the rumors. Some townsfolk let their imagination run wild. The lights are simply scholars working late with permission. I grant access to dedicated researchers pursuing legitimate study. Nothing mysterious about hard work and late hours."

### Stats
- **AC:** 10 (no armor, robes)
- **HP:** 18
- **Abilities:** STR 8, DEX 9, CON 11, INT 18, WIS 16, CHA 12

## Lyssa the Scholar
- **Type:** Human Wizard (Apprentice Level)
- **Age:** 24
- **Location:** Usually at a study table on the first or second floor, surrounded by open books
- **Status:** Alive, Intensely Focused
- **Relationship to Player:** Neutral (Friendly if approached respectfully during breaks)
- **Quest Connection:** Magical research, ancient lore, potential ally or information source

### Description
Lyssa is a young woman with dark hair pulled into a messy bun, intelligent green eyes, and ink smudges on her cheek from rubbing her face while reading. She wears practical traveling clothes under a scholar's robe, with a leather satchel containing her notes, quills, and spell components always nearby. Her table is invariably covered with open books, loose parchments covered in her small, precise handwriting, and occasionally a glowing arcane sigil for illumination.

### Dialogue
- **Initial Greeting:** *Looks up from her books* "Oh! Sorry, I didn't notice you. I get absorbed in research. Do you need this table? Or... are you researching something too? Always nice to meet a fellow scholar."
- **About Her Research:** "I'm studying the relationship between ley lines and architectural magic. Specifically, how ancient buildings like this library might have been constructed on sites of natural magical confluence. It's fascinating work, though Master Aldwyn thinks I'm chasing shadows. I'll prove my theory eventually."
- **About the Library:** "This library is incredible. I've been coming here for two years, and I still haven't explored everything. The restricted section on the third floor supposedly contains pre-kingdom era magical texts. Master Aldwyn won't let me up there yet—says I need more experience. Frustrating, but I understand. Some knowledge can be dangerous."
- **About Magic:** "Are you a practitioner? I'm still learning—apprentice level, really. My mentor sent me here to research independently. It's challenging but rewarding. The library has texts on evocation, divination, transmutation... if you're looking for spell theory, I can point you to the right sections. Or if you need help deciphering magical notation, I might be able to assist."
- **If Asked About Strange Occurrences:** "You mean the lights at night? I've seen them myself from outside. I'm not the only one working late, but Master Aldwyn is very selective about who gets after-hours access. Maybe someone on the third floor? I don't know. Part of me is curious, part of me thinks it's better not to ask too many questions. Ancient libraries have their secrets, right?"

### Stats
- **AC:** 11 (robes)
- **HP:** 20
- **Abilities:** STR 8, DEX 12, CON 12, INT 16, WIS 13, CHA 11
