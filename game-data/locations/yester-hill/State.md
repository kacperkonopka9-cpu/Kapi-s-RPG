# Yester Hill - Current State

## First Approach

Yester Hill rises before the party, a windswept hilltop crowned by ancient standing stones and dominated by the grotesque Gulthias Tree. This is the heart of the druid cult's power—where they worship Strahd, sacrifice victims, and birth blight abominations.

The stolen winery gem pulses within the tree's corrupted roots, its power twisted to create horrors instead of wine. Dozens of blights patrol the hilltop. Druid cultists perform their dark rituals, chanting prayers to the vampire lord. And in a hillside recess rests Wintersplinter—a 50-foot tree blight waiting for the command to march and destroy the Wizard of Wines.

The party must recover the gem, stop the druids, and prevent Wintersplinter's awakening. Time is not on their side.

## Environmental Conditions

- **Weather**: Windswept hilltop, exposed to elements
- **Terrain**: Standing stones, blood-slick ground around altar, dense undergrowth hiding blights
- **Atmosphere**: Oppressive corruption from Gulthias Tree, smell of rot and blood
- **Danger Level**: High (multiple CR 2-7 encounters, environmental hazards)

## Current Threats

- **Druid Cultists**: 3 spellcasters (CR 2 each), fanatic Strahd worshippers
- **Twig Blights**: 12 minions (CR 1/8), swarm tactics
- **Needle Blights**: 6 ranged attackers (CR 1/4)
- **Vine Blight**: 1 grappler (CR 1/2)
- **Wintersplinter** (dormant): CR 7 mega-blight, will awaken if druids desperate or ritual completed
- **Gulthias Tree**: Living hazard, spawns blights, animates branches if damaged

## Strategic Objectives

**Primary Quest**: Recover the winery magic gem from Gulthias Tree roots
**Secondary Quest**: Prevent Wintersplinter from awakening and marching to winery
**Optional Quest**: Destroy Gulthias Tree to end blight spawning permanently

## Quest Integration

This location is direct continuation of Wizard of Wines quest chain from Story 4-5:

**Winery Gem Recovery Arc:**
1. **Phase 1** (Story 4-5): Reclaim winery from druid siege
2. **Phase 2** (Yester Hill): Recover Red Dragon Crush gem
3. **Phase 3** (Berez): Recover Champagne du Stompe gem from Baba Lysaga

## Wintersplinter Timeline

**If Druids Undisturbed:**
- Ritual to awaken Wintersplinter completes in 2d4 days
- Once awakened, 2-hour march to Wizard of Wines
- Arrival at winery: Destroys one building per round until stopped

**If Party Attacks:**
- Druids attempt to awaken Wintersplinter immediately (takes 3 rounds)
- Party can interrupt ritual or face mega-blight
- If Wintersplinter awakens, creates time-sensitive chase scenario

## Available Resources

- **Stolen Wine Barrels**: 3 barrels in druid camp (can be returned to Martikovs)
- **Caged Prisoners**: 1d6 Barovian villagers awaiting sacrifice (can be freed)
- **Ritual Components**: Druidic focuses and herbs (150 gp value)
- **Strahd's Letters**: In druid leader's tent (lore value)

## Tactical Considerations

**Blight Vulnerability**: All blights take double damage from fire. *Fireball*, *Burning Hands*, or torches are highly effective.

**Druid Spells**: Cultists use Entangle and Spike Growth to control terrain. Ranged attacks or area-denial counters work well.

**Standing Stone Strategy**: Destroying stones (AC 17, HP 50 each) weakens Gulthias Tree by 10% HP per stone. Trade-off: Lose historical artifacts but make tree fight easier.

**Gem Extraction**: Requires 10 minutes of digging (DC 15 Strength check) or destroying tree entirely. Extracting gem first prevents its destruction during tree combat.

## Consequences

**Success Outcomes:**
- Gem recovered: Red Dragon Crush production resumes at winery
- Wintersplinter prevented: Winery safe from mega-blight assault
- Druids defeated: Cult presence in region eliminated
- Tree destroyed: Blight spawning ends, forests begin recovery

**Failure Outcomes:**
- Gem not recovered: Red Dragon Crush remains unavailable (economic impact)
- Wintersplinter awakens and escapes: Winery destroyed (major quest failure)
- Druids survive: Cult rebuilds, future attacks continue
- Tree survives: Blight infestation continues indefinitely

## Notes

Yester Hill represents the party's opportunity to strike back against Strahd's machinations. The druid cult serves him, the winery siege was his plan, and Wintersplinter is his weapon. Defeating the druids, recovering the gem, and destroying the corruption source is a tangible victory in a campaign filled with moral ambiguity.

But the challenge is real. Multiple enemies, environmental hazards, and the looming threat of a CR 7 boss make this a deadly location for unprepared parties. Fire is the key—blights burn easily, and smart use of fire magic can turn the tide.

The winery gem is non-negotiable. Without it, the Martikovs cannot fully restore wine production, settlements remain demoralized, and Strahd's economic warfare succeeds. This is a quest the party cannot afford to fail.
