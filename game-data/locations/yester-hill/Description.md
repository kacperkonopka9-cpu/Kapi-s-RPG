# Yester Hill - Description

## Overview

Yester Hill is a windswept hilltop crowned by a massive stone circle and dominated by the grotesque Gulthias Tree—a twisted, 200-foot-tall monstrosity sprouting from a dragon's heart. This sacred site serves as the headquarters for Barovia's druid cult, fanatic worshippers of Strahd who perform blood sacrifices and create blight creatures to spread the vampire lord's corruption. The druids have stolen one of the Wizard of Wines' magic gems and embedded it in the Gulthias Tree's roots, using its power to awaken Wintersplinter—a massive tree blight designed to destroy the winery.

The hill overlooks the valleys below, providing commanding views of the winery to the north and the forests to the south. Ancient standing stones ring the hilltop, carved with druidic symbols and Strahd's visage. At the center stands the Gulthias Tree, its bark pulsing with corrupted sap, its branches hung with corpses of sacrificial victims.

## Initial Description

The party climbs the windswept hill to find a scene of pagan horror. A ring of massive standing stones surrounds the summit, each carved with primitive images of Strahd worshipped as a god-king. The air reeks of rot and old blood. Ravens circle overhead, cawing warnings.

At the hill's center looms the Gulthias Tree—a towering abomination with black bark, crimson leaves, and roots that pulse like veins. Bodies hang from its branches, some recent, others reduced to swaying skeletons. The ground around the tree is stained dark with years of sacrificial blood.

Dozens of twig and needle blights shamble among the standing stones. Druid cultists in animal skull masks chant in dark tongues, their voices rising and falling in unholy rhythm. If the party arrives during ritual time, they witness druids feeding blood to the tree while it writhes in ecstasy.

## Return Description

On subsequent visits, the hill remembers. If the party slaughtered druids before, the survivors have prepared ambushes. If they negotiated, the druids watch warily. The Gulthias Tree's reaction depends on whether the party damaged it previously—if so, it pulses with malevolent awareness, its roots shifting to block escape routes.

If Wintersplinter has been awakened, the hilltop shows signs of the mega-blight's passage: crushed standing stones, massive track marks, and a sense of emptiness now that the druids' ultimate weapon has departed.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning
Morning light reveals the full horror of Yester Hill. The Gulthias Tree casts a long shadow across the valley. Blood stains on the stones glisten in the sun. Druids perform dawn rituals, sacrificing small animals to feed the tree. Blights are less active during daylight, many standing dormant among the stones until disturbed.

### Night
At night, the hill becomes truly sinister. The Gulthias Tree's bark glows with bioluminescent sap, pulsing like a heartbeat. Druids perform their darkest rites by moonlight, sacrificing larger victims and communing with Strahd's spirit. Blights are fully active, patrolling the perimeter. The standing stones cast eerie shadows that seem to move independently of their sources.

## Points of Interest

### The Gulthias Tree
The massive tree dominates the hilltop. Its trunk is 30 feet in diameter, its branches spread 150 feet wide. Bark is black and slick with sap. Leaves are deep crimson, dripping condensation that looks disturbingly like blood.

The tree grew from the heart of a slain green dragon (Argynvost's enemy from centuries past). Druid cultists discovered the heart and planted it here, using dark magic to grow this abomination. The tree spawns blight creatures: twig blights, needle blights, vine blights, and ultimately Wintersplinter itself.

**Embedded Gem**: One of the Wizard of Wines' magic gems (the one that produces Red Dragon Crush wine) is embedded in the tree's roots, its power corrupted to fuel blight creation. Recovering it requires digging into the root system (DC 15 Strength check, 10 minutes work) or destroying the tree entirely.

**Tree's Defenses**: If damaged, the tree animates its branches (melee attacks +8, 2d6+4 bludgeoning, 10-foot reach). It can also spawn 1d4 twig blights per round if threatened.

### The Standing Stones
Twelve massive stones form a perfect circle around the tree, each 15 feet tall and carved with primitive artwork depicting Strahd as a dark god. The stones radiate faint necromantic magic.

The stones serve as focal points for druid rituals. During ceremonies, druids stand at each stone, channeling energy into the Gulthias Tree. Destroying the stones weakens the tree's connection to dark magic (each stone destroyed reduces tree's HP by 10%).

### Blood-Stained Altar
A flat stone at the tree's base serves as sacrificial altar. Grooves carved into the stone direct blood flow toward the tree's roots. Fresh blood stains indicate recent sacrifices—possibly within the last day.

Examination (DC 13 Medicine check) reveals victims include humans, animals, and occasionally Barovian villagers kidnapped for ritual purposes.

### Wintersplinter's Recess
A massive depression in the hillside shows where Wintersplinter rested before awakening. The 30-foot-wide hollow is lined with roots and marked by deep gouges where the mega-blight tore itself free.

If Wintersplinter hasn't been awakened yet, the party can see it dormant here—a 50-foot-tall tree blight covered in frost, waiting for the druids' command to march on the Wizard of Wines.

### Druid Camp
Crude shelters and campfires dot the hill's northern slope. This is where the druid cultists live when not performing rituals. The camp contains:
- Animal skull totems on poles
- Piles of stolen goods from winery raids
- Cages holding captured animals (and possibly humanoid prisoners)
- Druid leader's tent (contains ritual notes and correspondence with Strahd)

### Valley Overlook
The hilltop provides commanding views. To the north lies the Wizard of Wines winery. To the south stretches endless dark forest. To the west, Castle Ravenloft rises like a distant shadow.

This vantage point explains why druids chose this location: They can observe the winery, plan attacks, and worship Strahd's castle on the horizon.

## Environmental Hazards

- **Blood-Slick Ground**: Areas around altar and tree are slippery (DC 12 Dexterity save to avoid falling prone during combat)
- **Blight Ambushes**: Dormant blights hide among stones and underbrush (DC 15 Perception to spot before they attack)
- **Unstable Stones**: Some standing stones have been weakened by age (if shoved or destroyed carelessly, 2d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures underneath)
- **Corrupted Air**: Prolonged exposure (4+ hours) to the tree's aura requires DC 13 Constitution save or suffer one level of exhaustion

## Strategic Notes

Yester Hill is designed for parties level 5-7. Encounters include:
- 8-12 twig blights (CR 1/8 each, swarm tactics)
- 4-6 needle blights (CR 1/4 each, ranged attacks)
- 3 druid cultists (CR 2 each, spellcasters)
- 1 vine blight (CR 1/2, grapple specialist)
- Wintersplinter (CR 7, optional boss if druids awaken it)

The druids will awaken Wintersplinter if losing the battle, creating climactic encounter where the party must either flee or face a mega-blight marching toward the winery.
