lore_significance: |
  Yester Hill is where druid fanatics worship Strahd as a dark nature god, believing his vampiric curse represents
  evolution's pinnacle. The Gulthias Tree grew from a slain dragon's heart, corrupted by druid magic into a blight
  factory. The druids stole the winery gems on Strahd's orders, using their power to create Wintersplinter—a living
  siege weapon designed to crush the Martikovs' resistance.

  The standing stones predate Strahd by centuries, originally erected by ancient druids who worshipped nature's
  balance. The current cult has perverted this legacy, carving Strahd's image onto the stones and performing blood
  sacrifices that would horrify their ancestors.

dm_notes: |
  Yester Hill is a mid-level dungeon (designed for parties 5-7) that tests combat tactics and time management. Key
  design elements:

  **Fire Vulnerability**: All blights take double fire damage. Parties with fire spells dominate; those without must
  adapt. This teaches resource management—save Fireball for blight swarms, use mundane fire for cleanup.

  **Wintersplinter Timing**: If awakened, creates time pressure. Party must choose: fight now (difficult but prevents
  march), pursue later (easier terrain advantages but risks winery destruction). This tests decision-making under
  pressure.

  **Gem Recovery**: Primary objective is non-negotiable for winery quest chain. Gem is in tree roots, requires
  digging or tree destruction. If party destroys tree carelessly, gem might be damaged (DM discretion on
  consequences).

  **Standing Stones**: Destroying historical artifacts to weaken tree creates moral choice. Is easier combat worth
  losing irreplaceable cultural heritage? Track player choices—some may refuse to destroy stones on principle.

  **Druid Tactics**: Cultists use Entangle/Spike Growth to create "kill zones" filled with blights. Intelligent
  players counter with ranged attacks, flight, or area denial. Punish players who charge blindly into prepared
  positions.

  **Wintersplinter Chase**: If mega-blight escapes and marches to winery, create cinematic chase. Party pursues
  through forest, launching attacks from trees/cliffsides. Wintersplinter ignores them, focused on winery
  destruction. Tension builds as winery approaches. Can party stop it in time?
