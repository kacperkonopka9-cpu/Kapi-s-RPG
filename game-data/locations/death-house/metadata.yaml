notes: "Introductory dungeon for Curse of Strahd campaign. Designed for level 1-3 characters. Features timed escape sequence after boss defeat. Quest-critical for establishing Barovia's horror atmosphere. Connects to Old Bonegrinder via deed document. Rose and Thorn are tragic figures meant to elicit sympathy before revealing the house's dangers. Boss encounter (CR 5) may be difficult for low-level parties—escape is a valid option if outmatched."
