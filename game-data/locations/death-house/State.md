# Death House - Current State

## Exterior

The house stands silent and imposing at the village edge, its windows dark, its door slightly ajar. Two children (Rose and Thorn) linger nearby, looking cold and lost.

## Interior Status

The house appears abandoned but strangely well-preserved. Dust covers the furniture, but nothing shows signs of decay or looting. The building waits.

## Supernatural Activity

The house is dormant, its malevolent intelligence sleeping. It will awaken when intruders venture deep enough—specifically, when they discover the basement entrance. Once awakened, the house will trap them inside until they confront the horror in the ritual chamber.

## Quest Status

**The Durst Children's Request**: Rose and Thorn seek help destroying the "monster in the basement" and laying their parents to rest. Quest not yet accepted.
