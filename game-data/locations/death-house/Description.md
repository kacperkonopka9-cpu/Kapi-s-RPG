# Death House - Description

## Overview

Death House stands at the edge of the Village of Barovia, a townhouse that looms with an oppressive presence despite its elegant facade. This four-story structure serves as a cruel welcome to Barovia, a haunted mansion that traps those who enter and feeds on their fear. Built by the Durst family, it conceals dark secrets in its basement—a dungeon shrine to Strahd and a sacrificial cult chamber where terrible rituals were performed.

## Initial Description

The house appears abandoned but well-maintained, its darkwood walls and stonework untouched by weather or time. Tall windows stare blankly from the upper floors. A wrought-iron gate stands open, inviting visitors up the weed-choked path to the front entrance. Two carved gargoyles perch on the roof's edge, their stone eyes following movement below.

Inside, the house seems frozen in time. Dust covers fine furniture. Portrait paintings watch from the walls. Children's voices echo faintly from upstairs, though no children can be found. The air smells of rot beneath perfume, and shadows move in peripheral vision.

## Return Description

The house remembers those who've entered before. Doors that were open now stand closed. Furniture has shifted positions. The whispers are louder, more insistent. The building itself seems aware of the party's presence, guiding them deeper into its depths with creaking floorboards and flickering candlelight that leads toward the basement stairs.

## Time-Based Variants

### Morning

Morning light offers no respite from Death House's oppression. The building remains as dark and foreboding in daylight as it does at night. Shadows linger in corners despite the sun, and the house's interior stays dim regardless of hour. The whispers continue, the creaking persists, and the malevolent presence never sleeps. Investigating during daylight provides slightly better visibility but no actual safety—the house's horrors are not bound by time of day.

### Night

After dark, Death House fully awakens. Candlelabras light themselves. The children's specters become visible on the third floor, beckoning visitors to play. The animated armor in the hallway patrol routes become more aggressive. Fog billows under doors and through cracks, filling rooms with thick mist that obscures vision and muffles sound.

## Points of Interest

### Entrance Hall

Grand foyer with marble floors and a sweeping staircase. A coat rack, a large mirror, and an ornate chandelier hang from the ceiling. The Durst family coat of arms is displayed prominently—a windmill.

### Main Floor

Dining room with a long table set for a feast that never came. Kitchen with rusted utensils and moldy food. Den with comfortable chairs, a fireplace, and bookshelves containing Barovian histories and dark rituals.

### Upper Floors

Second floor: Master bedroom, bathroom, library, and a conservatory with dead plants. Third floor: Children's bedrooms (Rose and Thorn's rooms), nursery, and storage. The attic contains a hidden staircase.

### Basement

The dungeon beneath Death House contains prison cells, a torture chamber, and the cult initiation chamber—a ghoulish shrine to Strahd with a sacrificial altar. A shambling mound of flesh and bone guards the ritual chamber, the culmination of the family's dark experiments.

### Secret Passages

Hidden doors connect the third floor to the attic and the attic to the basement dungeon. The house's architecture defies logic—rooms connect in impossible ways, and escape routes vanish once the house decides its victims have gone far enough.
