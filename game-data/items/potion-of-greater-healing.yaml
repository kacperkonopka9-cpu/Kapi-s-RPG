# === LORE & HISTORY ===
lore:
  description: "A crystal vial containing a vibrant red liquid that sparkles with magical energy. The potion swirls gently on its own, even when at rest, and emits a faint warm glow. When shaken, tiny motes of golden light dance within the liquid. The potion smells sweet and fruity, reminiscent of cherries and cinnamon. Greater healing potions are among the most sought-after consumables by adventurers, capable of saving lives in critical moments."

  history: "Healing potions are created by skilled alchemists, herbalists, and clerics who combine rare herbs, purified water, and healing magic. Greater healing potions require more potent ingredients and stronger enchantments than standard healing potions. They are valuable commodities, often found in healers' shops, temple infirmaries, and the treasure hoards of those wise enough to prepare for danger. In Barovia, where healing magic is precious and clerics are rare, these potions are worth their weight in gold."

  tacticalUse:
    bestUsedWhen:
      - "Character is below half HP in combat"
      - "Preventing death - healing an unconscious ally"
      - "Before a big fight to ensure full HP"
      - "After combat to conserve spell slots"

    actionEconomyConsiderations:
      - "Using a potion takes an action (cannot attack that turn)"
      - "Healing Word (bonus action spell) may be more action-efficient in combat"
      - "Potions don't require spell slots - good for preserving caster resources"
      - "Thief rogues can drink as bonus action (very powerful combo)"

  administrationRules:
    selfUse: "Drink as action, regain 4d4+4 HP"
    helpOther: "Use action to administer to adjacent creature (willing or unconscious)"
    unconsciousTarget: "Can be administered to unconscious ally (they regain HP and may regain consciousness if HP > 0)"
    forcedConsumption: "Unwilling creatures can be forced to drink with grapple + action"

# === BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS ===
balance:
  powerLevel: "uncommon"
  recommendedLevel: 3
  notes: "A solid mid-tier healing consumable. 14 average healing is significant at lower levels (half the HP of a 5th level fighter) but less impactful at higher levels. Single-use nature creates resource management decisions. Widely useful across all character types since it doesn't require spellcasting."

  dmGuidance:
    - "Greater healing potions are good rewards for completing quests or finding treasure"
    - "Stock 1-2 potions per character for dungeon delves or major encounters"
    - "Prices in Barovia: 100-200 gp (if available for purchase at all)"
    - "NPCs may trade valuable information or services for healing potions"
    - "The Vistani may sell potions but at inflated prices (200-300 gp)"
    - "Finding a cache of healing potions can be a reward in itself"
    - "Don't make potions too scarce - they're a safety net for parties without healers"

# === VISUAL DESCRIPTION ===
appearance:
  visual: "A delicate crystal vial, approximately 4 inches tall, with a cork stopper sealed with red wax. The vial contains a vibrant crimson liquid that swirls with inner luminescence. Tiny golden motes drift through the liquid like stars in a red sky. The glass is slightly warm to the touch and the liquid gives off a faint, sweet aroma reminiscent of cherries, cinnamon, and honey. A label (if present) identifies it as 'Greater Healing Potion' in elegant script."

  activeState: "When the cork is removed, the sweet aroma intensifies and the liquid glows brighter. When consumed, the potion tastes like warm honey mixed with spiced fruit - pleasant and comforting. The liquid feels warm going down and spreads a tingling sensation through the body as wounds close and vitality returns."

  soundEffects: "Opening the vial produces a soft 'pop' as the seal breaks. Drinking the potion makes a gentle glug-glug sound. As the magic takes effect, there's a brief sensation of warmth and the sound of a heartbeat growing stronger."
