# === LORE & HISTORY ===
lore:
  description: "The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is a unique platinum amulet, shaped as a sunburst with a large crystal embedded at its center. The symbol is warm to the touch and radiates a comforting light. It is a holy relic created by clerics of the Morninglord and was brought to Barovia centuries ago to combat the growing darkness. It is both a powerful magic item and a sentient ally against evil."

  history: "The symbol was crafted by the ancient Order of the Silver Dragon, clerics and paladins devoted to the Morninglord (Lathander). It was brought to Barovia shortly after Strahd's transformation into a vampire, intended as a weapon against him. The symbol has changed hands many times over the centuries, sometimes held by heroes who challenged Strahd, other times hidden away or lost. It remains one of the few items Strahd genuinely fears."

  legendsAndRumors:
    - "The symbol was blessed by the Morninglord himself and contains a fragment of divine power"
    - "It can paralyze even the most powerful vampires with a single word"
    - "The symbol chooses its bearer and will not work for those of evil heart"
    - "It whispers guidance to those who carry it, warning of danger and evil"
    - "Strahd once tried to destroy the symbol but failed, and now seeks to bury it where it can never be found"

# === IDENTIFYING THE ITEM ===
identification:
  basePropertiesReveal: "on_attunement"
  fullPropertiesReveal: "The symbol reveals its powers through telepathic communication with its attuned bearer. It explains its abilities and purpose over time."

  hiddenProperties:
    - "The sentience of the symbol is not immediately apparent - it waits to assess its bearer before communicating"
    - "The command word for Hold Vampires is inscribed in Celestial on the back of the symbol"
    - "The symbol's ability to compel its bearer to act righteously is only discovered if the bearer acts contrary to its purpose"

# === LOCATION IN CURSE OF STRAHD ===
locationInfo:
  whereFound: "Determined by Tarokka reading at campaign start"

  howObtained: "The Tarokka reading reveals one of several possible locations. Common locations include: The Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk (in the Abbot's possession), Castle Ravenloft (in Strahd's treasury), the church in Vallaki, or the ruins of Argynvostholt."

  guardian: "Varies by location - may be guarded by the Abbot, Strahd's minions, or hidden in a trapped reliquary"

  notes: "The symbol's light may be visible from a distance, potentially alerting enemies. Strahd is aware of the symbol's existence and will take steps to prevent the party from obtaining it if he learns of their search."

# === BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS ===
balance:
  powerLevel: "legendary"
  recommendedLevel: 5
  notes: "Extremely powerful for clerics and paladins. The +2 to spell DC and attack rolls is significant, and the Hold Vampires ability can turn the tide against Strahd. The sunlight aura provides constant protection but also makes stealth impossible. The sentience adds roleplay depth but also constraints on the bearer's actions."

  dmGuidance:
    - "The symbol should be found mid-campaign to give the bearer time to build a relationship with it"
    - "Roleplay the symbol's personality - it should offer guidance, warnings, and occasionally moral challenges"
    - "The symbol genuinely wants to help but has strong opinions about how to confront evil"
    - "If the bearer repeatedly acts against the symbol's wishes, consider escalating to the compulsion mechanic"
    - "Strahd will not willingly enter the 30-foot sunlight radius unless absolutely necessary"
    - "The Hold Vampires ability is a one-use-per-day trump card - Strahd will remember if it's used against him"

# === VISUAL DESCRIPTION ===
appearance:
  visual: "A platinum amulet in the shape of a stylized sunburst, with twelve rays extending from a central disc. A large crystal, clear as diamond but warm as amber, is set in the center. The crystal glows with soft golden light. Inscribed on the back in Celestial script is the command word 'Osanna' (meaning 'Save us'). The amulet hangs on a fine platinum chain."

  activeState: "The crystal pulses with golden light, and the platinum rays shimmer as if reflecting sunlight. The 30-foot radius of bright light makes the bearer clearly visible, and the symbol itself is warm against the chest."

  soundEffects: "When the Hold Vampires ability is activated, the symbol chimes like a temple bell. When communicating telepathically, the bearer hears the symbol's voice as warm and resonant, like a choir singing in harmony."
