# === LORE & HISTORY ===
lore:
  description: "An elegant shortbow crafted from flexible wood and enhanced with minor enchantments. The bow is slightly lighter than a normal shortbow and the string never frays. Arrows fired from this bow fly straighter and strike harder than those from mundane bows. The wood has a faint silvery sheen, indicating its magical nature."

  history: "Magical bows are prized by hunters, scouts, and rangers who rely on ranged combat. This shortbow was likely crafted by an elven bowyer or a human artisan with access to magical materials. The enchantments enhance the bow's accuracy and the force of its arrows. Such weapons are valuable in Barovia, where keeping distance from threats can mean the difference between life and death."

# === BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS ===
balance:
  powerLevel: "uncommon"
  recommendedLevel: 3
  notes: "A solid upgrade for ranged weapon users. The +1 bonus makes the bow more accurate and slightly more damaging. Appropriate for characters who rely on ranged attacks. Does not overshadow other magic items but remains useful throughout the campaign."

  dmGuidance:
    - "Can be given relatively early (levels 3-5) without balance concerns"
    - "Particularly valuable for rangers, rogues, and fighters using archery fighting style"
    - "Remember that ammunition must still be tracked (arrows are consumable)"
    - "The bow is magical but normal arrows are not unless specifically enchanted"

# === VISUAL DESCRIPTION ===
appearance:
  visual: "A gracefully curved shortbow approximately 3 feet in length when strung. The wood is smooth and polished, with a subtle silvery-gray tint. The bowstring appears to be made of fine silk or sinew and is always taut and perfect. The grip is wrapped in soft leather dyed forest green. Small runes are etched near the grip, barely visible unless examined closely. The bow has an elegant, flowing design that suggests elven craftsmanship."

  activeState: "When drawn, the bow feels effortless to pull, the string releasing smoothly with minimal vibration. Arrows nocked on the string seem to align perfectly with the target. A faint shimmer runs along the bow's length when an arrow is drawn."

  soundEffects: "The bow makes a clear, musical 'twang' when fired, and the arrows it launches fly with a distinctive whisper. The sound is quieter than a mundane bow, making it suitable for stealthy attacks."

# === TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS ===
tacticalUse:
  advantages:
    - "Allows engagement at range (80 ft normal, 320 ft maximum)"

    - "Can be used while mounted (unlike crossbows which require reloading)"
    - "Works well with archery fighting style (+2 to hit, stacks with +1 from bow)"
    - "Enables sneak attack damage for rogues without risk of melee"

  disadvantages:
    - "Requires ammunition (arrows must be tracked and purchased/crafted)"
    - "Two-handed weapon (cannot use shield)"
    - "Less effective in melee range (disadvantage if enemy within 5 feet)"
    - "Projectiles may be ineffective against some creatures (incorporeal, amorphous)"
