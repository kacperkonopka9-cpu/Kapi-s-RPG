# === LORE & HISTORY ===
lore:
  description: "A well-crafted longsword with a blade that holds a faint magical shimmer. The sword is perfectly balanced and seems to strike true more often than an ordinary blade. The crossguard is simple but elegant, and the grip is wrapped in quality leather. This is a reliable weapon for any warrior, enhanced with minor enchantments to improve accuracy and striking power."

  history: "Magic weapons like this longsword are created by skilled artisans working in cooperation with enchanters. The blade is forged from high-quality steel and then imbued with minor enchantments that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Such weapons are relatively common among professional soldiers, knights, and adventurers who can afford them. This particular longsword may have been crafted for a Barovian knight, commissioned by a wealthy merchant, or brought to Barovia from lands beyond the mists."

# === BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS ===
balance:
  powerLevel: "uncommon"
  recommendedLevel: 3
  notes: "A straightforward upgrade from a mundane longsword. The +1 bonus provides a meaningful but not overwhelming improvement. Appropriate for Tier 1-2 play (levels 1-10). Does not overshadow more powerful magic items but remains useful throughout the campaign."

  dmGuidance:
    - "Can be given relatively early (levels 3-5) without breaking balance"
    - "Multiple party members can have +1 weapons without issue"
    - "This is a good 'first magic weapon' reward"
    - "No special features means no complexity in tracking effects"

# === VISUAL DESCRIPTION ===
appearance:
  visual: "A well-maintained longsword with a straight, double-edged blade of silvery steel. The blade is 3 feet long with a fuller running down the center. The crossguard is simple and functional, made of steel with a subtle etched pattern. The grip is wrapped in dark brown leather, worn smooth by use. The pommel is a simple steel sphere. The blade has a very faint shimmer when light catches it at the right angle - the only outward sign of its magical nature."

  activeState: "In combat, the blade feels perfectly balanced in the hand, seeming to guide itself toward targets. The magical shimmer becomes slightly more pronounced when the sword is swung."

  soundEffects: "The sword makes the normal sounds of a well-made blade - a clear ring when drawn, a crisp swish when swung through the air, and a satisfying impact when striking targets."
